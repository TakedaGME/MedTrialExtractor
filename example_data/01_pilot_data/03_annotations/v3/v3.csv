PTEN expression is also decreased in many sporadic breast cancers . Breast cancers with increased levels of AKT phosphorylation / activation and cancers exhibiting a gene expression signature of PTEN loss show poor disease outcome [ 1 ] . Loss of PTEN activity and activation of PI3 K signaling are associated with resistance to endocrine therapy [ 2 ] and trastuzumab [ 3,4 ] . Most PTEN - low tumors and many of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PIK3CA ) mutant tumors activate AKT for oncogenic signaling . Thus , the PI3K / AKT pathway is a promising target for breast cancer therapy .","Background","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Submit arm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High Ang2 levels are associated with poor patient survival in multiple malignancies , breast cancer among others [ 14][15][16][17][18][19 ] . Some of the Ang / Tie system targeted antibodies have already been evaluated in clinical trials , but so far , the effects of anti - Ang2 monotherapy have been modest [ 20][21][22 ] . A better understanding of Ang function is clearly needed for the rational development of effective Ang - pathway targeted therapies . Although Tie1 expression in endothelial cells is increased in tumor vessels and deletion of the Tie1 gene in tumor - bearing mice decreased tumor growth and angiogenesis in preclinical experiments [ 4,23 ] , the significance of Tie1 in tumor progression is also unclear . Tie1 ectodomain cleavage occurs in vivo in association with acute [ 11 ] and chronic inflammation [ 24 ] , leading to increased concentration of the soluble extracellular domain in the serum of patients with severe viral infections [ 11 ] .

LMP1 and LMP2 in particular behave like B cell receptor ( BCR)mediated Akt , which is dependent upon spleen tyrosine kinase and Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) . These tyrosine kinases contribute to enhanced cellular proliferation and survival signaling such as the nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - κB ) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K / Akt ) pathways [ 6 ] . In our experiment , we transfected vector - encoding LMP1 or LMP1_delCTAR1(C - terminal - activating region 1 ) and LMP1_delCTAR2 into a DLBCL cell line and observed the BCR signaling pathway ( Supplementary Materials and methods ) . As a result , the BTK signaling pathway was activated when LMP1 was expressed . It was also confirmed that the CTAR1 of LMP1 was an important domain for BTK activation . In addition , cell viability was decreased when the BTK inhibitor ( ibrutinib ) was treated with LMP1-expressing cells ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Based on previous studies that proved the efficacy of rituximab - cyclophosphamidedoxorubicin hydrochloride - vincristine sulfate - prednisone ( RCHOP ) therapy combined with ibrutinib ( I - RCHOP ) , we designed this study to boost the anti - tumor effect of EBVpositive DLBCL [ 7,8 ] .

The optimal duration of lenalidomide maintenance is a matter of debate . In Cancer and Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) [ 3 ] and Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome ( IFM ) [ 2 ] trials , patients received post - ASCT placebo or continuous lenalidomide 10 mg for 3 months escalated then to 15 mg , until disease progression , intolerable side effects , or death . The IFM group decided to stop the treatment in the lenalidomide arm due to the noticed risk of secondary primary malignancies ( SPMs ) in opposite to the CALGB trial where patients continued maintenance until progression . Based on the meta - analysis , the risk of death due to SPM was similar between lenalidomide and placebo or observation groups but there was a 34 % reduction in risk to die of multiple myeloma ( MM ) in lenalidomide maintenance arm [ 5 ] .","Introduction","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Submit arm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The event - free survival ( EFS ) was calculated as the time from inclusion to any of the following : PD , death or withdrawal from study for any reason . The Kaplan - Meier method with log - rank test was used to estimate the survival distribution . Competitive risk analysis method was used to analyze , which factors showed independent predictive value for myeloma outcome in multivariate models , using PFS as outcome indicator and withdrawal from study for other reasons than PD or death as a competitive event . Hazard ratios with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) and p values were reported in all regression models .

The following studies have confirmed the superiority of survival benefits using paclitaxel into cisplatin - based regimens in place of cyclophosphamide for the treatment of patients with ETOC and PPSC [ 20,21 ] .

According to the definition of the Gynecologic Oncology group ( GOG ) for ' optimal ' as having residual tumor nodules which should be ≤ 1 cm in size , the Cochrane review revealed that the outcome of ETOC patients with residual disease ≤ 1 cm is better than of those with residual disease > 1 cm [ 143 ] , although it is well known that PCS to no gross residual tumor might be associated with the longest PFS and OS [ 144,145 ] . One study showed an interesting finding that patients still had diverse outcomes despite undergoing optimal PCS ( ≤ 1 cm residual disease ) , in which it demonstrated that patients with a tumor limited in a single anatomic location had better median PFS and OS than patients with tumors widely distributed in multiple anatomic locations [ 146 ] .","The Benefits of Maximal Cytoreductive Surgery and The Consideration of the Location of Residual Tumors","arm_efficacy_metric","","","","","","","137,138","PFS","","","","","","","","","Submit arm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subsequently , more patients with lowgrade lymphoma received the 2 × 2 Gy scheme : Table 1 [ 3 - 8 ] shows a summary of different trials using 2 × 2 Gy LDRT , and CR rates range from 37 % to 82 % . In a subset of patients ( low tumor burden , fewer previous chemotherapies , age of less than 65 years , and treatment with curative intent ) , LDRT showed excellent results ; ORR and CR rate ranged from 93 % to 81 % and from 57 % to 90 % , respectively [ 5,6,8 ] . The mode of action of 2 × 2 Gy is not completely understood . An induction of the p53 pathway is discussed [ 9,10 ] .

The CR rates were 40 % after LDRT ( total response rate of 74 % ) and 60 % after 24 Gy ( total response rate of 81 % ) . There were significantly more recurrences ( n = 70 ) in the LDRT arm after a median follow - up time of 26 months as compared with the 24-Gy arm ( 21 recurrences ; hazard ratio 3.42 ; P < 0.0001 ) . However , this trial has several major weaknesses ( e.g. , no limitation or stratification of lymphoma size ; no differentiation between FL grade 1 , 2 , 3a , or 3b ; no central pathological review ; and no standardized follow - up with three - dimensional imaging ) [ 12 ] . In summary , the FORT trial showed some efficacy after LDRT , but in light of the mentioned issues , it is not clear whether the difference between LDRT and 24 Gy was as large as published . In addition , no anti - CD20 antibody was applied and this might result in an increased radiosensitivity of the FL cells [ 13 ] .","Radiation dose","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Submit arm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The risk of development of secondary primary malignancies varied across studies , but an increased risk was demonstrated with lenalidomide maintenance versus placebo in the meta - analysis [ 4,5,8,9 ] .","Introduction","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Submit arm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also , mRCC is highly resistant to chemotherapy and radiation treatment [ 3,4 ] . In recent years , progress has been made in the treatment of advanced or metastatic RCC and multiple targeted therapies have been approved , including tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors ) , and the antivascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab in combination with interferon alpha [ 5 ] . These targeted therapies have shown clinical activity and prolonged survival in patients with mRCC [ 6 ] ; however , responses are generally short - lived , development of treatment resistance is common [ 5,7 ] , and different classes of targeted therapy are associated with characteristic toxicity profiles that have implications for patient treatment selection [ 5 ] .","Background","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Submit arm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover , increased PD-1 / L1 expression in RCC is associated with aggressive pathological features and a worse prognosis [ 10][11][12 ] . In patients with mRCC , anti - PD-1 and anti - PD - L1 antibodies have shown promising responses and improved overall survival ( OS ) , both as monotherapy and in combination with other classes of agents . Nivolumab ( anti - PD-1 ) was the first agent in this class to be approved by regulatory authorities , based on findings from the randomized phase III CheckMate 025 trial , which compared nivolumab monotherapy with everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who had received prior antiangiogenic therapy [ 13 ] . More recently , nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab ( anti - cytotoxic T - lymphocyte protein 4 ) was approved for patients with previously untreated , intermediate - or poor - risk , advanced RCC , based on OS data from the phase III CheckMate 214 trial of nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared with sunitinib [ 14 ] .","Background","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Submit arm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prognosis of individual patients is highly heterogeneous : current treatment algorithms do well for some patient groups with a median survival of more than 10 years , while a significant proportion of patients shows median survival of 2 years or even below [ 6,7 ] . This frequently prompts the suggestion to treat the latter patients differently , most often more aggressively , in other terms to perform risk - adapted treatment , e.g. , UAMS total therapy [ 8 ] , mSMART by the Mayo Clinic [ 9 ] , or the GMMG - CONCEPT trial ( NCT03104842 ) .","Background","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Submit arm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time , prognostic power can be increased by assessing gene expression , i.e. , proliferation [ 13 ] and high risk scores [ 14][15][16][17][18][19][20 ] , e.g. , by DNAmicroarrays ( gene expression profiling , GEP ) .

Patients often present with advanced disease with worldwide 5-year survival rates of 9 % , reducing to 3 % for metastatic pancreatic cancer [ 2 ] . Median progression - free survival ( PFS ) with standard - of - care first - line treatments is around 6 months and disease progression can result in deterioration in health - related quality of life ( HRQoL ) [ 3,4 ] . As a consequence , patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer have reduced HRQoL due to high emotional burden , symptom burden ( in particular pain , fatigue , vomiting and diarrhoea ) , and poor prognosis [ 5][6][7][8][9][10 ] . When evaluating the best treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer , it is important to not only assess survival , which is relatively short , but also ensure that there are no detrimental effects of treatment on HRQoL. Indeed , American Society for Clinical Oncology guidelines on treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer recommend that clinicians should proactively discuss quality of life issues such as pain , fatigue , and loss of appetite , which tend to be overlooked yet have significant impact on daily life , with their patients [ 11 ] .","Introduction","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Submit arm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of maintenance treatment is to prolong PFS , and ultimately overall survival , delaying the need for subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy . In addition , maintenance treatment should seek to preserve HRQoL , which may be improved following effective first - line chemotherapy [ 13 ] . First - line treatment with FOLFIRINOX has been shown to improve overall HRQoL and lead to a decrease in some symptoms , including pain , for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer [ 13 ] . A prespecified secondary objective of the POLO trial was to evaluate the effect of olaparib on HRQoL , specifically the adjusted mean change from baseline in Global Health Status ( GHS ) score using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30-item module ( EORTC QLQ - C30 ) .","Introduction","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Submit arm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore , mutations in RAS or BRAF have been suggested as predictive biomarkers for MEK inhibition . 8,9 In previous clinical trials , selumetinib , an inhibitor of MEK1/ 2 , demonstrated interesting activity and acceptable tolerability in patients with metastatic BTC . 10,11 Similarly , binimetinib is a potent , adenosine triphosphate - uncompetitive , highly selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/2 with on - target activity that has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo . 12 Moreover , phase I study of binimetinib showed a manageable safety profile , target inhibition and dose - proportional exposure . 13 In this study , we evaluated the preclinical synergistic activity of binimetinib and fluoropyrimidine against BTC cell lines . Supported by the preclinical results , we then conducted a phase Ib study of binimetinib and capecitabine in gemcitabinepretreated BTC patients to assess the safety and early antitumor activity .
