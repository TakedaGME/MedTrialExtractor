The mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) inhibitor everolimus has become well - established as an effective therapy for NET arising from the pancreas , lung , or GI tract , with an associated median progression - free survival ( PFS ) of 11.0 months [ 3,4 ] . mTOR kinase is a serine / threonine kinase that serves as a core component of two complexes ; mTORC1 and mTORC2 . The former modulates cell proliferation via phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 ( 4E - BP1 ) and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 ( S6K1 ) , whereas the latter acts via phosphorylation of AKT [ 5 ] . Everolimus inhibits the mTORC1 complex but may upregulate mTORC2 , which thus maintains AKT activation . Consequently , inhibitors that can target both complexes may offer clinical advantages in terms of improved efficacy [ 5][6][7][8][9][10 ] .",Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,47720caf-fff2-49f6-a224-c60810f45c0e,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

In order to better manage the toxicity profile of such hypofractioned regimens ( mainly related to risk of vertebral fracture [ 18 ] ) further studies [ 19,20 ] have suggested the possibility of using a hypofractionated regimen over the entire bone compartment and going to over - dose with a stereotactic regimen only for the macroscopically visible disease from instrumental examinations . In patients with more favorable prognosis , this regimen could improve the possible onset of acute and late complications , while increasing the RT dose to the bulky lesion .",Final considerations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,47dbfcec-bcb5-44c7-a556-f1da18f4767b,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Single fraction ( 8Gy ) RT should be preferred for patients with inferior prognosis . Fractionated schedules are therefore often preferred for patients with better prognosis ( i.e. , > 6 months ) : the most widely adopted and supported by expert consensus is represented by 20Gy delivered in 5 fx of 4 Gy [ 23 ] . Routine use of prognostic scores to characterize life expectancy and define the most appropriate treatment regimen is very rarely applied in everyday clinical practice . Some randomized trials [ 8,12 ] are underway investigating the role of SBRT compared to conventional approaches for these patients , though not all of them through patient selection by validated prognostic scores . At the present time , a study by Guckenberger et al . ( NCT02800551 , DOSIS RCT , https:// clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02800551 ) is directly comparing a schedule administering 20 Gy in 5 fx to SBRT - SIB given with 5 or 10 fx .",Final considerations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,d7134d28-2f31-4d2d-800a-484c71de5968,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

It binds covalently to the minor groove of DNA and disrupts transcription regulation , leading to G2-M cell cycle arrest and ultimately apoptosis . 4 Preclinical studies indicate that trabectedin , besides having a potent antiproliferative effect , modifies the tumour microenvironment by reducing the number and function of macrophages in the tumour stroma ( tumour associated macrophages - TAM ) . Since TAM produce several angiogenic factors , their inhibition by trabectedin results in an anti - angiogenic effect that is demonstrated well in preclinical systems . 5,6 Bevacizumab is an antibody that binds and inactivates VEGF , the main factor that hypoxic cancer cells produce to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis . The mechanisms of resistance to bevacizumab are not fully clear yet but it seems likely that the reduced function of VEGF pathways is compensated by overproduction of other angiogenic factors . 3 The combination of compounds that inhibit several angiogenic pathways could , therefore , be advantageous for a prolonged antiangiogenic effect and the combination of trabectedin with bevacizumab inhibit several of these mechanisms at the same time .",BACKGROUND,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,e8d405f9-aebc-4ff0-8b73-5ca4d588cce2,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

In 2018 , over 1,000,000 new cases were diagnosed with GC and approximately 783,000 deaths ( equating to 1 in 12 deaths worldwide ) . [ 1 ] Most patients ( > 70 % ) with GC are diagnosed at the advanced stage , [ 2 ] as a consequence , it shows a disappointing result . [ 3,4 ] Accumulating evidence shows that only 5 % of patients with metastatic cancer are still alive 5 years after diagnosis . [ 5 ] In recent years , immune microenvironment has been increasingly valued for its crucial role in the process of GC onset and progression . [ 6][7][8 ] Although surgical resection , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biologic therapeutic agents , and other measures have been used to improve the therapeutic efficacy of GC , [ 9 ] the prognosis is still dismal . [ 10 ] Thus , it is important to explore new strategies to prolong the survival , improve the quality of life of the advanced GC patients . Fortunately , traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) has its unique advantages in preventing and treating GC [ 11,12 ] and it also has an efficacy in improving immune function . [ 13 ] The JPYZXZ decoction is a traditional Chinese herbal formulation created by Professor Shenlin Liu , the national famous Chinese Physician .

[ 1][2][3 ] However , the fourth phase 3 trial , GOG252 that reduced the cisplatin dose from 100 mg / m 2 to 75 mg / m 2 neither showed a survival benefit in IP Carboplatin nor in IP Cisplatin , 4 which highlights the controversy of IP chemotherapy in ovarian cancer . Our recent study reported disease progression delayed by additional dose - dense early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( DD - EPIC ) with weekly cisplatin and etoposide ( AICE trial ) in the front - line setting . 5 The primary endpoint of the AICE phase 2 trial showed a 28 % increase in 12-month nonprogression rate in ovarian cancer patients in favour of the DD - EPIC group [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.48 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.27 - 0.82 , P = 0.005 ] .

Constitutive activation of either of these TKs plays a central role in the oncogenic behavior of GIST [ 6,7 ] . The early characterization of GIST mutational status is important in both the localized and metastatic settings to identify mutations which are primarily resistant to imatinib ( such as PDGFRA D842V ) , or exon 9 mutation which requires a higher dose of imatinib in the advanced setting [ 8,9 ] . Patients with GIST lacking KIT or PDGFRA mutations typically do not experience objective responses to imatinib . However , other mutations may be present in these tumors , with the largest group represented by succinate dehydrogenase - deficient GIST by immunochemistry , which may reflect underlying alterations in an succinate dehydrogenase subunit , and may be associated with familial heritable syndromes ( Carney triad or Carney - Stratakis syndrome ) [ 10][11][12][13][14 ] . Other subtypes of GIST lacking activating mutations in KIT or PDGFRA may have mutations in NF1 ( usually associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 ) or in BRAF or KRAS [ 15][16][17 ] .

Localized , resectable tumors are treated surgically which remains the mainstay of curative therapy for localized disease . Resected high - risk GIST is typically treated with adjuvant imatinib following surgery , whereas low - risk GIST is managed with surgery alone . Intermediate - risk GIST is managed on a per - case basis [ 2,21,22 ] . In the advanced / metastatic setting , imatinib 400 mg daily is approved , with dose escalation to 800 mg at the time of progression , and has been shown to yield dramatic results in disease control [ 23][24][25 ] .

The KIT receptor is composed of an extracellular domain , a transmembrane hinge , a juxtamembrane ( JM ) domain that serves as an inhibitory switch , and a cytoplasmic region with a TK domain comprising a TK1 domain and a TK2 domain separated by a kinase insert domain ( Figure 1 ) [ 28 ] . ATP is anchored in the TK1 domain , and phosphorylation of substrates occurs in the TK2 domain . An activation loop ( activating switch ) , which stabilizes KIT in the active or ' on ' state , is also located in the TK2 domain .

Secondary resistance mutations usually arise in the catalytic domain of the kinase : at the switch pocket , which typically occur in KIT exons 13 and 14 or PDGFRA exons 14 and 15 and sterically disrupt drug binding or conformationally activate KIT and in the activation loop switch encoded by KIT exons 17 and 18 and PDGFRA exon 18 [ 29,44,45 ] . Activation loop mutations act by shifting the kinase into an activated Type I or on - state conformation that is less amenable to drug binding by any of the approved Type II TKIs [ 46 ] . Although uncommon in primary GIST ( 1 - 2 % of newly diagnosed cases ) , mutations in exons 13 , 14 and 17 are often responsible for acquired imatinib resistance [ 38 ] , with exon 17 mutations alone accounting for as many as 50 % of the acquired resistance cases to imatinib ; exon 17 mutations also result in resistance to sunitinib [ 38,47 ] .

This profile is achieved through a unique dual mechanism of action that secures the kinase into an inactive conformation or off state , resulting in the inhibition of downstream signaling . Ripretinib acts as a structural surrogate for the inhibitory switch by binding to the switch pocket . This prevents access to the switch pocket by the activation loop , thereby locking the kinase into the inactive state . Additionally , ripretinib binds to the activation loop further preventing its access to the switch pocket and blocking kinase activity . Taken together , this dual mechanism of action secures KIT and PDGFRA kinases in their inactive conformations resulting in inhibition of proliferation .

In a phase II study , adding chemotherapy to bevacizumab in patients whose tumors already progressed on bevacizumab monotherapy was associated with little to no benefit . 2 Mechanisms underlying resistance to antiangiogenesis agents in GBM are inadequately understood , but may include upregulation of alternative pro - angiogenic pathways , vessel co - option , increased invasiveness , and immune activation . 3 Plasma levels of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) increase in GBM patients treated with anti - VEGF receptor ( VEGFR ) at the time of tumor progression , suggest that signaling by bFGF may play a role in resistance to antiangiogenesis agents . 4,5 In addition , preclinical evidence suggests that activation of Src family kinases plays an important role in glioma invasion . 6,7 Multikinase inhibitors targeting not only VEGFR but also fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) and Src may potentially help overcome some of the putative mechanisms of resistance and result in increased antitumor effects .",| INTRODUCTION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,9f8c55ec-b879-43d3-bc91-1a754f0cab64,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

We have previously performed several clinical trials of a 24-h continuous intravenous infusion of irinotecan , given biweekly , combined with oral FUs ( UFT and UFT plus leucovorin ) , in patients with mCRC and reported that these regimens are therapeutically useful and have low incidences of diarrhea and other adverse events [ 8,9 ] .

The three major subtypes of MZL defined by the World Health Organization ( WHO)-are splenic MZL , mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) MZL , and nodal MZL [ 3,4 ] , which are determined by the anatomical location of disease - initiating B - cells [ 5 ] . MALT is the most common MZL subtype , with an estimated 5-year overall survival ( OS ) and progression - free survival ( PFS ) > 90 % and 70 % while nodal MZL has been associated with most frequent relapse cases [ 2,[6][7][8 ] .

Typically , patients suffer multiple relapses , and subsequent lines of therapy for MZL patients achieve progressively shorter responses [ 9 ] , therefore , extending the period of remission for MZL patients remains an essential goal . One potential strategy is the use of maintenance therapy once a response has been achieved with first - line therapy . Several NHL studies have previously evaluated rituximab as a maintenance agent [ 14,15,[28][29][30][31 ] . FL patients who receive rituximab - maintenance therapy after responding to first - line rituximab and chemotherapy experience significantly longer PFS compared to those receiving standard treatment [ 14,15 ] .

In metastatic patients , radiotherapy is frequently administered for several reasons , for instance to ease tumor pain , to increase bone stability or to mitigate localized disease symptoms and conditions from mass effects to tumor infiltrations such as bleeding , ulceration or organ compressions [ 1 ] . Recently , immunotherapies have been introduced as new treatment modalities aiming for the disinhibition of the natural antitumoral immune response . Significant benefits translating into tremendously improved progression - free survival and overall survival rates have been described for patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma and melanoma and lately also for patients with squamous or non - squamous NSCLC [ 2][3][4][5 ] . Among the many potential molecular structures that may be targeted pharmacologically , treatments directed against the PD-1/ PD - L1 immune checkpoint have improved survival at the cost of only modest toxicity for NSCLC patients in both 1st - and 2nd - line treatment situations . However , response rates range around only 20 % in previously treated patients , and also frontline administration of PD-1 inhibitors results in no tumor response in approximately half of the treated patients [ 4,6,7 ] . In order to identify patients more likely to respond to PD-1 blockade the expression of PD - L1 on tumor cells has been introduced as a biomarker . The utility of PD - L1 as a predictive biomarker , however , is still under debate , and alternatives such as tumor mutation burden ( TMB ) are now taken into account [ 7][8][9 ] .",Background,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,e0753fb0-0418-4056-b89d-24c63f0ad085,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Radiation is known to induce immunogenic cell death , which is a unique expression pattern of cell damage - derived proteins from both tumor and stromal cells that may activate the immune system and promote the recognition of tumor - associated/−specific proteins elsewhere in the body [ 10,15,16 ] .",Background,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,ba8b8968-54b8-4f36-b951-a4c0f86b72d2,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Thus , the clinical observation of any abscopal effect with radiation alone has always been a rare finding . With the advent of agents that target PD-1 / PD - L1 and therefore disinhibit tumor - directed immune responses , the potential of inducing an abscopal effect through combined radio - immunotherapies has gained renewed attention . Interestingly , a secondary analysis of a clinical landmark trial has identified 98 patients , who had received photon radiotherapy prior to immunotherapy [ 19 ] . These patients showed significantly improved PFS and OSirrespective of the expression of PD - L1 . This finding hasonce again nourished the hope that the combination of pharmacological disinhibition of the immune system through medical immunotherapies and tumor - antigen - exposing photon radiation may be a beneficial combination .
