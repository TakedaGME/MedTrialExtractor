These differences in survival outcomes may be due to differences in patient baseline characteristics , healthcare , and post - progression treatment across the different regions [ 14 ] , and highlight the importance of subgroup analyses according to regions . Here , we report results from a subgroup analysis of the JACOB trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in Japanese patients .","Introduction","","","194,200","","","207,214","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","0c2ea3d1-9b2b-4dad-b3c8-c397cfc84e7b","arm_description-1","","","","","194,196,199,200","subgroup analysis trial","","","","","207,214","pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

The study was prompted by the phase 3 JGOG-3016 trial in which weekly paclitaxel ( 80 mg / m² ) in combination with 3-weekly carboplatin ( area under the curve[AUC]6 ) was found to confer improved progression - free survival and overall survival when compared with standard treatment in Japanese patients with advanced ovarian cancer . 1 As there is increasing evidence of pharma cogenomic distinctions between Asian and white populations , ICON8 was designed to explore whether the survival advantage observed in JGOG-3016 could also be observed in a mostly European population with ovarian cancer . 2,3 Results from ICON8 have shown that weekly , dose - dense paclitaxel - containing chemotherapy conferred no progression - free survival advantage when com pared with standard 3-weekly treatment . 4 As a secondary endpoint of the main study , the effect on health - related quality of life ( referred to as quality of life throughout this Article ) was assessed during treatment and in follow - up .

Despite the generally favorable toxicity profile of SABR , emerging data indicate that patients with pre - existing ILD are at particularly high risk of toxicity after SABR . A recent meta - analysis examined outcomes after several different treatments for early - stage lung cancer in patients with ILD [ 10 ] . Within the meta - analysis , 13 published studies ( Additional file 1 ) assessed outcomes after SABR . Overall , the use of SABR in patients with earlystage NSCLC and pre - existing ILD was associated with a 25 % risk of radiation pneumonitis ( grade 3 or higher ) and a 15 % risk of treatment - related death . The risk may be highest in the subset of patients with IPF : SABRrelated mortality was 33 % in studies limited to IPF patients , and 14 % in other studies that included only non - IPF fibrotic ILD , or a combination of IPF and non - IPF fibrotic ILD patients ( p = 0.092 ) .","Interstitial lung disease and SABR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","3736000b-efab-455d-b94e-0fbd52dd3c0c","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

The ILD - GAP index assigns an overall score between 0 and 8 , with the majority of points assigned based on current pulmonary function . 3-year mortality ranges from 10 % in patients with an index of 0 - 1 to 75 % in patients with an index > 5 . Notably , all patients with IPF or unclassifiable ILD have a minimum index of 2 in the ILD - GAP model , reflecting their inferior prognosis .

The option of delivering no treatment whatsoever , which avoids any risk of treatment - related toxicity , is associated with a high risk of death due to the lung cancer itself . The median survival for untreated stage I NSCLC is only 6 - 8 months , with 1-year mortality of 60 - 70 % [ 12 ] , much higher than the risks associated with SABR treatment . For example , in one study of untreated patients with NSCLC in the U.S. National Cancer Database , the median survival for patients with stage I NSCLC who were unfit for an operation was 7.6 months [ 13 ] .

Adjustments to the SABR fractionation schedule may reduce the risk of toxicity , while still maintaining some benefit . Radiation dose is expressed in Gray ( Gy ) , with most SABR treatments delivering approximately a total dose 50 - 60 Gy . This total dose is divided up into smaller individual fractions of radiation . Conventional radiotherapy employs fraction sizes of approximately 2 Gy per day , 5 days per week , and would require 30 fractions to deliver 60 Gy . This prolonged treatment time ( i.e. 6 weeks of treatment ) may allow for tumor repopulation , compromising treatment outcomes . With SABR , common fractionations include 54 Gy in 3 fractions ( i.e. 18 Gy per fraction ) , 48 Gy in 4 fractions ( i.e. 12 Gy per fraction ) and 60 Gy in 8 fractions ( i.e. 7.5 Gy per day ) .

Endocrine therapies targeting the oestrogen receptor are an integral component of treat ment for oestrogen receptorpositive breast cancer , but resistance develops in almost all patients with advanced disease . Several resistance mechanisms have been identified , including alteration of the PI3K / AKT pathway . This pathway is altered in more than 50 % of oestrogen receptorpositive advanced breast cancers , most frequently through somatic hotspot mutation in exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA , encoding the p110α isoform of PI3K. [ 1][2][3][4 ] Less frequently , pathway alteration is induced by loss of function mutation or deletion of the negative regulator PTEN or activating mutations in AKT1 . PI3 K pathway alteration is associated with endocrine therapy resistance through ligand inde pendent activation of the oestrogen receptor . 5,6 Conversely , preclinical data show compensatory increases in liganddependent oestrogen receptor transcription following PI3 K pathway inhibition . [ 7][8][9 ] A rationale therefore exists for simultaneously targeting both the oestrogen receptor and PI3 K pathways .","Introduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","7d97eac1-70a5-4873-8379-3d4024ac0ec9","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

The mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) inhibitor everolimus has become well - established as an effective therapy for NET arising from the pancreas , lung , or GI tract , with an associated median progression - free survival ( PFS ) of 11.0 months [ 3,4 ] . mTOR kinase is a serine / threonine kinase that serves as a core component of two complexes ; mTORC1 and mTORC2 . The former modulates cell proliferation via phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 ( 4E - BP1 ) and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 ( S6K1 ) , whereas the latter acts via phosphorylation of AKT [ 5 ] . Everolimus inhibits the mTORC1 complex but may upregulate mTORC2 , which thus maintains AKT activation . Consequently , inhibitors that can target both complexes may offer clinical advantages in terms of improved efficacy [ 5][6][7][8][9][10 ] .","Introduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","47720caf-fff2-49f6-a224-c60810f45c0e","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

These particular cases are often debated with regard to whether they should receive conventional antalgic radiotherapy or higher radiotherapy ( RT ) doses in order to better control symptoms . Technological improvements ( e.g. , stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) ) [ 2,3 ] and advanced treatment planning ( e.g. , intensity modulated RT ( IMRT ) ) [ 4 ] can enhance RT treatment efficacy by dose escalation to offer more effective pain ( and potentially disease ) control without compromising the organ at risk ( OAR ) through toxicity .","Background","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","a56b4ba4-4dea-4c6e-8954-bc56dd3dfed2","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

It binds covalently to the minor groove of DNA and disrupts transcription regulation , leading to G2-M cell cycle arrest and ultimately apoptosis . 4 Preclinical studies indicate that trabectedin , besides having a potent antiproliferative effect , modifies the tumour microenvironment by reducing the number and function of macrophages in the tumour stroma ( tumour associated macrophages - TAM ) . Since TAM produce several angiogenic factors , their inhibition by trabectedin results in an anti - angiogenic effect that is demonstrated well in preclinical systems . 5,6 Bevacizumab is an antibody that binds and inactivates VEGF , the main factor that hypoxic cancer cells produce to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis . The mechanisms of resistance to bevacizumab are not fully clear yet but it seems likely that the reduced function of VEGF pathways is compensated by overproduction of other angiogenic factors . 3 The combination of compounds that inhibit several angiogenic pathways could , therefore , be advantageous for a prolonged antiangiogenic effect and the combination of trabectedin with bevacizumab inhibit several of these mechanisms at the same time .","BACKGROUND","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","e8d405f9-aebc-4ff0-8b73-5ca4d588cce2","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

In 2018 , over 1,000,000 new cases were diagnosed with GC and approximately 783,000 deaths ( equating to 1 in 12 deaths worldwide ) . [ 1 ] Most patients ( > 70 % ) with GC are diagnosed at the advanced stage , [ 2 ] as a consequence , it shows a disappointing result . [ 3,4 ] Accumulating evidence shows that only 5 % of patients with metastatic cancer are still alive 5 years after diagnosis . [ 5 ] In recent years , immune microenvironment has been increasingly valued for its crucial role in the process of GC onset and progression . [ 6][7][8 ] Although surgical resection , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biologic therapeutic agents , and other measures have been used to improve the therapeutic efficacy of GC , [ 9 ] the prognosis is still dismal . [ 10 ] Thus , it is important to explore new strategies to prolong the survival , improve the quality of life of the advanced GC patients . Fortunately , traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) has its unique advantages in preventing and treating GC [ 11,12 ] and it also has an efficacy in improving immune function .

In addition , treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with fulvestrant has established CDK4/6 inhibitor combination therapy in HR+ , HER2-ABC in postmenopausal women who have progressed on antiestrogen therapy [ 20,21 ] . Both PALOMA-3 [ 20 ] and MONARCH 2 [ 21 ] included pre / perimenopausal women ; however , these women made up only a minority of the enrolled patients . The MONALEESA trials have further investigated new patient populations and CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations in the first - line ABC treatment setting . MONALEESA-3 is a Phase III study investigating CDK4/6 inhibition plus fulvestrant in de novo HR+ , HER2-ABC and as first - line treatment for advanced disease in postmenopausal patients [ 13 ] . MONALEESA-7 is the only study to investigate CDK4/6 inhibition in a large population composed entirely of pre / perimenopausal women [ 14 ] . On the basis of findings from MONALEESA-3 and MONALEESA-7 , ribociclib has been approved for the treatment of HR+ , HER2-ABC in combination with either an AI or fulvestrant in postmenopausal women and in combination with an AI in pre / perimenopausal women [ 22 ] .","Background & rationale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","4899878a-3444-4a9e-ac79-63051eb17c83","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

[ 1][2][3 ] However , the fourth phase 3 trial , GOG252 that reduced the cisplatin dose from 100 mg / m 2 to 75 mg / m 2 neither showed a survival benefit in IP Carboplatin nor in IP Cisplatin , 4 which highlights the controversy of IP chemotherapy in ovarian cancer . Our recent study reported disease progression delayed by additional dose - dense early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( DD - EPIC ) with weekly cisplatin and etoposide ( AICE trial ) in the front - line setting . 5 The primary endpoint of the AICE phase 2 trial showed a 28 % increase in 12-month nonprogression rate in ovarian cancer patients in favour of the DD - EPIC group [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.48 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.27 - 0.82 , P = 0.005 ] . Despite the increased toxicity in the DD - EPIC group , most toxicities were acceptable , and the completion rate was much higher than that in GOG172 , with the infection rate 11.6 % in AICE vs. 16 % in GOG172 , and a completion rate of IP chemotherapy 90.6 % vs. 42 % , respectively . 2,5 The mean inpatient cost in the DD - EPIC group was not much higher than that in the control group ( $ 9338.2 vs. $ 7424.4 ) .","BACKGROUND","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","5e6ccbb2-c003-4918-8e13-b102cd1d4d2d","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

Enhancing the interoperability of EHRs and improving the capture of outcomes data are core goals of regulatory and private sector efforts to promote meaningful use of health information technology ( HIT ) . [ 25 ] Modifying EHRs to include structured fields that capture progression and response and training clinicians to enter relevant data into the correct fields may provide an easier path to capturing outcome measures in oncology clinical practice settings , and facilitate both retrospective and prospective studies of real - world outcomes .

Constitutive activation of either of these TKs plays a central role in the oncogenic behavior of GIST [ 6,7 ] . The early characterization of GIST mutational status is important in both the localized and metastatic settings to identify mutations which are primarily resistant to imatinib ( such as PDGFRA D842V ) , or exon 9 mutation which requires a higher dose of imatinib in the advanced setting [ 8,9 ] . Patients with GIST lacking KIT or PDGFRA mutations typically do not experience objective responses to imatinib . However , other mutations may be present in these tumors , with the largest group represented by succinate dehydrogenase - deficient GIST by immunochemistry , which may reflect underlying alterations in an succinate dehydrogenase subunit , and may be associated with familial heritable syndromes ( Carney triad or Carney - Stratakis syndrome ) [ 10][11][12][13][14 ] . Other subtypes of GIST lacking activating mutations in KIT or PDGFRA may have mutations in NF1 ( usually associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 ) or in BRAF or KRAS [ 15][16][17 ] . Very recently , cases of GIST - like tumors harboring NTRK translocations have further expanded the spectrum of molecular subtypes [ 18 ] .","Disease overview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","05884b69-aa0a-495e-9b2f-dd8f27f21f28","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

The KIT receptor is composed of an extracellular domain , a transmembrane hinge , a juxtamembrane ( JM ) domain that serves as an inhibitory switch , and a cytoplasmic region with a TK domain comprising a TK1 domain and a TK2 domain separated by a kinase insert domain ( Figure 1 ) [ 28 ] . ATP is anchored in the TK1 domain , and phosphorylation of substrates occurs in the TK2 domain . An activation loop ( activating switch ) , which stabilizes KIT in the active or ' on ' state , is also located in the TK2 domain . When ligand , stem cell factor , binds to KIT , the kinase domain becomes activated and stimulates downstream pathways , including Ras / Raf / MAPK , PI3K / Akt / mTOR , and Src kinase pathways , resulting in cellular proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis [ 28 ] .

These dual switches regulate kinase activity by binding to the kinase switch pocket . The switch pocket is an area in the kinase that is adjacent to the ATP pocket . This pocket determines if the kinase will be in the ' on ' or ' off ' state . If the inhibitory switch binds to the switch pocket , the kinase is in the off state and is inactive . If the activation loop switch binds to the switch pocket , the kinase is in the on state and is active ( Figure 2 ) [ 29 ] .

Secondary resistance mutations usually arise in the catalytic domain of the kinase : at the switch pocket , which typically occur in KIT exons 13 and 14 or PDGFRA exons 14 and 15 and sterically disrupt drug binding or conformationally activate KIT and in the activation loop switch encoded by KIT exons 17 and 18 and PDGFRA exon 18 [ 29,44,45 ] . Activation loop mutations act by shifting the kinase into an activated Type I or on - state conformation that is less amenable to drug binding by any of the approved Type II TKIs [ 46 ] . Although uncommon in primary GIST ( 1 - 2 % of newly diagnosed cases ) , mutations in exons 13 , 14 and 17 are often responsible for acquired imatinib resistance [ 38 ] , with exon 17 mutations alone accounting for as many as 50 % of the acquired resistance cases to imatinib ; exon 17 mutations also result in resistance to sunitinib [ 38,47 ] .

Ripretinib inhibits primary and secondary mutations on relevant exons that drive resistance to approved targeted therapies by regulating the kinase switch pocket and activation loop ; inhibition of activation loop mutations has previously only been targeted by Type I ( binds to the kinase ATP pocket in the active conformation ) inhibitors [ 29,49 ] . This profile is achieved through a unique dual mechanism of action that secures the kinase into an inactive conformation or off state , resulting in the inhibition of downstream signaling . Ripretinib acts as a structural surrogate for the inhibitory switch by binding to the switch pocket . This prevents access to the switch pocket by the activation loop , thereby locking the kinase into the inactive state . Additionally , ripretinib binds to the activation loop further preventing its access to the switch pocket and blocking kinase activity . Taken together , this dual mechanism of action secures KIT and PDGFRA kinases in their inactive conformations resulting in inhibition of proliferation .

In a phase II study , adding chemotherapy to bevacizumab in patients whose tumors already progressed on bevacizumab monotherapy was associated with little to no benefit . 2 Mechanisms underlying resistance to antiangiogenesis agents in GBM are inadequately understood , but may include upregulation of alternative pro - angiogenic pathways , vessel co - option , increased invasiveness , and immune activation . 3 Plasma levels of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) increase in GBM patients treated with anti - VEGF receptor ( VEGFR ) at the time of tumor progression , suggest that signaling by bFGF may play a role in resistance to antiangiogenesis agents . 4,5 In addition , preclinical evidence suggests that activation of Src family kinases plays an important role in glioma invasion . 6,7 Multikinase inhibitors targeting not only VEGFR but also fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) and Src may potentially help overcome some of the putative mechanisms of resistance and result in increased antitumor effects .","| INTRODUCTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","9f8c55ec-b879-43d3-bc91-1a754f0cab64","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

Three - month progression - free survival was chosen since agents with anti - VEGFR activity may produce pseudoresponses , making response a less reliable endpoint .

A Simon optimal two - stage design was used to permit early termination of the study in case of futility . The first stage accrued 15 participants . If at least five or more of the first 15 participants achieved PFS3 , accrual was increased to 12 more participants for a total of 27 participants .

We have previously performed several clinical trials of a 24-h continuous intravenous infusion of irinotecan , given biweekly , combined with oral FUs ( UFT and UFT plus leucovorin ) , in patients with mCRC and reported that these regimens are therapeutically useful and have low incidences of diarrhea and other adverse events [ 8,9 ] .

In Korea , MZL is the second most frequent histological NHL subtype after diffuse large B - cell lymphoma , constituting one - fifth of all NHL cases [ 2 ] . The three major subtypes of MZL defined by the World Health Organization ( WHO)-are splenic MZL , mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) MZL , and nodal MZL [ 3,4 ] , which are determined by the anatomical location of disease - initiating B - cells [ 5 ] . MALT is the most common MZL subtype , with an estimated 5-year overall survival ( OS ) and progression - free survival ( PFS ) > 90 % and 70 % while nodal MZL has been associated with most frequent relapse cases [ 2,[6][7][8 ] . Overall , MZL is characterized by an indolent clinical course [ 5 ] , yet remission is often followed by multiple relapses [ 9,10 ] , highlighting the need for tolerable maintenance treatments that can extend the remission periods induced by first - line therapies .","Background","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","59a6d5ba-2686-4fe7-a97d-a847283699ec","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

Rituximab is a chimeric , monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 , a cell surface antigen expressed during most stages of B - cell development [ 12 ] , and is found on 95 % of B - cell lymphoma cells [ 13 ] . The clinical efficacy of rituximab was first demonstrated in follicular lymphoma ( FL ) [ 14,15 ] and it has since been prescribed for other subtypes of NHL , including MZL , with promising results [ 16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24 ] .

Typically , patients suffer multiple relapses , and subsequent lines of therapy for MZL patients achieve progressively shorter responses [ 9 ] , therefore , extending the period of remission for MZL patients remains an essential goal . One potential strategy is the use of maintenance therapy once a response has been achieved with first - line therapy . Several NHL studies have previously evaluated rituximab as a maintenance agent [ 14,15,[28][29][30][31 ] . FL patients who receive rituximab - maintenance therapy after responding to first - line rituximab and chemotherapy experience significantly longer PFS compared to those receiving standard treatment [ 14,15 ] . Similar results were reported for the randomized phase III primary rituximab and maintenance ( PRIMA ) trial , in which 2 years of rituximab - maintenance therapy significantly improved the 6-year PFS in FL patients who responded to first - line rituximab and chemotherapy combination treatment , compared to patients on standard therapy [ R - CVP or R - CHOP ( rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisolone ) ] alone [ 28,29 ] .","Background","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","62c41321-8769-4dca-9ad3-64196ebe6553","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

In metastatic patients , radiotherapy is frequently administered for several reasons , for instance to ease tumor pain , to increase bone stability or to mitigate localized disease symptoms and conditions from mass effects to tumor infiltrations such as bleeding , ulceration or organ compressions [ 1 ] . Recently , immunotherapies have been introduced as new treatment modalities aiming for the disinhibition of the natural antitumoral immune response . Significant benefits translating into tremendously improved progression - free survival and overall survival rates have been described for patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma and melanoma and lately also for patients with squamous or non - squamous NSCLC [ 2][3][4][5 ] . Among the many potential molecular structures that may be targeted pharmacologically , treatments directed against the PD-1/ PD - L1 immune checkpoint have improved survival at the cost of only modest toxicity for NSCLC patients in both 1st - and 2nd - line treatment situations . However , response rates range around only 20 % in previously treated patients , and also frontline administration of PD-1 inhibitors results in no tumor response in approximately half of the treated patients [ 4,6,7 ] . In order to identify patients more likely to respond to PD-1 blockade the expression of PD - L1 on tumor cells has been introduced as a biomarker . The utility of PD - L1 as a predictive biomarker , however , is still under debate , and alternatives such as tumor mutation burden ( TMB ) are now taken into account [ 7][8][9 ] .","Background","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","e0753fb0-0418-4056-b89d-24c63f0ad085","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

Specifically , photon radiation to one metastatic site has been observed to elicit a response to non - irradiated tumor sitescommonly referred to as the abscopal effect , which was first described in 1953 [ 14 ] . Radiation is known to induce immunogenic cell death , which is a unique expression pattern of cell damage - derived proteins from both tumor and stromal cells that may activate the immune system and promote the recognition of tumor - associated/−specific proteins elsewhere in the body [ 10,15,16 ] .","Background","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","ba8b8968-54b8-4f36-b951-a4c0f86b72d2","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

Thus , the clinical observation of any abscopal effect with radiation alone has always been a rare finding . With the advent of agents that target PD-1 / PD - L1 and therefore disinhibit tumor - directed immune responses , the potential of inducing an abscopal effect through combined radio - immunotherapies has gained renewed attention . Interestingly , a secondary analysis of a clinical landmark trial has identified 98 patients , who had received photon radiotherapy prior to immunotherapy [ 19 ] . These patients showed significantly improved PFS and OSirrespective of the expression of PD - L1 . This finding hasonce again nourished the hope that the combination of pharmacological disinhibition of the immune system through medical immunotherapies and tumor - antigen - exposing photon radiation may be a beneficial combination . However , to date results from prospective clinical trials investigating this hypothesis in lung cancer patients are not available .","Background","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","36c021c6-6462-4093-bc00-b17d2d7b1df4","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

Indeed , prior work demonstrated that localized prostate tumors with a basal lineage program are much less likely to respond to ADT vs. patients whose tumors harbor a luminal lineage program ( 22 ) . Therefore , we next sought to measure signatures of these lineages ( 26 ) and determine if they were differentially activated between nonresponders and responders . Our analysis demonstrates that a basal lineage , neurogenic / stemness program is activated in nonresponders to enzalutamide treatment , while a luminal lineage program is more activated in responders ( Fig . 5C ) , corroborating the prior work in prostate cancer examining the effect of basal lineage on promoting resistance to ADT ( 22 ) .","Significance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","71ce5a5e-ddd5-43b7-892f-a39bc12a4fb8","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

Thus , development of alternative myeloma drugs for the refractory setting in particular is an urgent priority . Repurposing of well - known drugs approved for use in other therapeutic settings can potentially provide a shortcut to the development of new myeloma treatments 4 . The best example of this strategy is the success of thalidomide , which now shapes an entire class of myeloma agents , after originally being developed as a hypnotic agent .","Introduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","d97866e3-ba5f-4641-9683-a62dd6cb256b","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

It has single - agent activity against myeloma in vivo , inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells via multiple pathways , including inhibition of proteasomal degradation and the PI3K / Akt pathway [ 5][6][7 ] and importantly , by inducing endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress . In a phase I trial ( SAKK 65/08 ) 8 we showed that nelfinavir inhibited proteasome activity and significantly upregulated the expression of proteins related to the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PMBC ) . This key modulator of protein production , folding and destruction 9,10 , also determines proteasome inhibitor sensitivity . Combination of nelfinavir with bortezomib further induced the UPR and overcame proteasome inhibitor resistance 8 . A subsequent phase II trial ( SAKK 39/13 ) demonstrated promising clinical activity of a nelfinavir - bortezomib - dexamethasone combination , with an unprecedented overall response rate of 65 % in heavily pretreated , proteasome inhibitor - refractory MM patients 11 . Preclinical data indicate that nelfinavir was able to overcome resistance to the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib via modulation of multidrug resistance ( MDR ) efflux pumps such as ABCB1 ( ref . 12 ) . As lenalidomide is a substrate of the same pump family 12 , and via binding to the E3 ligase cereblon , works on the ubiquitin - proteasome system , we postulated that nelfinavir might likewise be able to overcome resistance to immunomodulatory drugs .","Introduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","04e8609a-4dc5-46b2-af03-dbc036fd6ab9","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

Trifluridine is incorporated into DNA after phosphorylation by thymidine kinase 1 ( TK1 ) . We previously reported results from a randomized phase 2 study of trifluridine / tipiracil ( J003 - 10040030 ) , and this therapy was first approved in Japan in 2014 [ 8 ] . More recently , the international phase 3 RECOURSE trial has demonstrated a more significant overall survival ( OS ) benefit of trifluridine/ tipiracil compared with placebo , with acceptable toxicity , in patients with refractory mCRC [ 7 ] . In addition , the Asian phase 3 TERRA trial has reported the survival benefit and safety of trifluridine / tipiracil in Asian population [ 9 ] . Based on these findings , trifluridine / tipiracil has been approved by many countries and regions including the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency .","Background","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","2d390242-fd26-4ac8-a4b1-bd78a91239f4","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

The primary endpoint of 16-week progression - free survival ( PFS ) was 42.9 % [ 80 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 27.8 - 59.0 ] . The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events were neutropenia ( 72 % ) , leucopenia ( 44 % ) , anemia ( 16 % ) , febrile neutropenia ( 16 % ) , and thrombocytopenia ( 12 % ) [ 11 ] . Managing the higher incidence of hematological toxicities is crucial to reduce the risks of serious treatment - related adverse events and maximize the efficacy of trifluridine / tipiracil plus bevacizumab treatment . Furthermore , the non - comparative phase 2 TASCO1 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of trifluridine / tipiracil plus bevacizumab and capecitabine plus bevacizumab and provided evidence demonstrating the efficacy of trifluridine / tipiracil plus bevacizumab in patients with untreated mCRC who were not eligible for standard first - line intensive therapy .

Therefore , therapies that stimulate the immune system can benefit patients , both early in their disease course and after relapse ( Kumar & Anderson , 2016;Guillerey et al , 2016 ) . Pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent that exerts potent direct tumoricidal and immune - stimulating effects through binding to its target cereblon , a protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex , and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos ( Lopez - Girona et al , 2012;Bjorklund et al , 2015 ) . Compared with lenalidomide , pomalidomide has increased potency against cereblon , different substrate degradation kinetics , and a distinct gene activation profile , and thus , pomalidomide has antitumor and immune stimulating properties distinct from those of lenalidomide ( Lopez - Girona et al , 2012;Bjorklund et al , 2015;Ocio et al , 2015;Sehgal et al , 2015 ) . Pomalidomide also has activity in lenalidomide - resistant cell lines and animal models , and pomalidomide - based therapy has exhibited efficacy in patients refractory to lenalidomide in clinical trials ( Lopez - Girona et al , 2012;Leleu et al , 2013;San Miguel et al , 2013;Richardson et al , 2014;Ocio et al , 2015;Rychak et al , 2016;Dimopoulos et al , 2016a ) .","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","0dcecd3e-9245-43f1-a76f-e40ce2fc3146","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

Once a patient with metastatic CRC has experienced progression on first and second - line chemotherapy and biological therapies , the survival benefit of remaining therapies is limited [ 2,3 ] . In addition , therapeutic options may be constrained by patient comorbidities , age , or performance status . Novel therapeutic regimens are needed that are both tolerable and provide meaningful clinical benefit . Ziv - aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein containing portions of the extracellular domains of VEGFR1 ( also known as Flt-1 ) and VEGFR2 ( also known as KDR or Flk-1 ) . Ziv - aflibercept binds vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A , VEGF - B , and placental growth factor ( PlGF ) , thereby inhibiting VEGF - mediated angiogenesis [ 4 ] . Ziv - aflibercept is approved by the United Stated Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) for use in combination with Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , leucovorin , and irinotecan ( FOLFIRI ) for the second line treatment of metastatic CRC [ 5 ] . In the phase III VELOUR trial , the addition of ziv - aflibercept to FOLFIRI in patients with metastatic CRC resulted in a survival of 13.5 months , compared to 12.1 months for FOLFIRI alone ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.82 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.71 - 0.94 ; P < 0.01 ) [ 6 ] .","Introduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","def1d84f-1123-4001-a67e-ebff785824e9","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

In 2015 , the incidence and mortality of glioma in China were approximately 101600 and 61000 , respectively , with a ratio of 3:2 for men and women [ 2 ] . The incidence of glioma in general increases with age , from 0.9 in children to 12.1 in the elderly [ 3 ] . Patients with glioma usually have poor survival rates and unfavorable prognosis . The etiology of glioma remains poorly understood and is attributed to different genetic or environmental factors [ 4 ] . Recently , a vast number of studies have reported that genetic factors contribute to the development of glioma , which revealed single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in cancer - related genes were associated with glioma susceptibility and prognosis [ 5][6][7 ] .","Introduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","6f400c60-3d35-4b5c-99fd-a73e4ce5de10","title","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

Several studies have demonstrated MAML2 abnormal expression in various cancers , such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma , hidradenoma and breast cancer [ 11][12][13 ] . These studies have suggested that MAML2 might be involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of cancers . Based on microarray data of glioma , MAML2 as a novel gene related to glioma was identified [ 14 ] . Additionally , epidemiological studies have confirmed that polymorphisms in MAML2 , a NOTCH pathway gene , were related to cancer susceptibility and prognosis [ 15,16 ] .

During that time , the Intermediate Clinical Endpoints in Cancer of the Prostate surrogacy work showed that measures based on metastatic progression could be used as a surrogate for survival in patients presenting with M0 disease , allowing trials in that setting to achieve increased power sooner [ 2 ] .

However there is still controversy about patient stratification and selection for treatment . Metastatic burden sub - group analyses of the CHAARTED and GETUG-15 trials have led some to conclude that docetaxel should not be given as a first - line treatment of patients presenting with ' low metastatic burden ' disease [ 3,[9][10][11 ] . This represents $ 40 % of patients presenting with de novo mHNPC [ 12,13 ] . These were retrospective analyses of relatively small subgroups of these trials and a number of groups have not been persuaded by these exploratory retrospective analyses .

The lowest PSA value within the first 24 weeks after enrolment was used to define a nadir , from which an increase of 50 % and to a minimum level of 4 ng / ml indicated biochemical progression .

The completion rate over time was close to those observed in other clinical trials in pancreatic cancer , such as in a phase II clinical trial in resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer patients using also the QLQ - C30 questionnaire to assess HRQoL among other questionnaires . 24 These missing data also had a direct impact on the population for analysis . It was required to define a modified ITT population including all ITT patients with a baseline HRQoL score available .

There were no baseline clinical characteristics that were predictive of which patients received DRs . However , DRs generally occurred more frequently in females . Additionally , median weights , as well as the lower - and upper - range bounds for weight , were lower in patients in both DR groups than in those remaining at 45 mg QD for the duration of treatment ( Supplementary Table 1 ) .","Patients","","","","","","10,11,61,63","3,9","","","","","","","","","","["""",""""]","","f53b1a2f-65ad-4bee-9216-9f7fdb03f941","arm_dosage-6","","","","","","","","","","","10,11,61,63","dacomitinib dacomitinib arm","6,9","45-mg QD dose","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Validate annotation"

After 80 cycles ( 75 months ) , Weibull plotted survival was < 0.01 % and therefore assumed to be 0 . Because transition probabilities to the PPS state are not explicitly modelled in a partitioned survival model , entry into the PPS state each cycle was calculated by subtracting a specific background mortality from the proportion of patients leaving PFS .
