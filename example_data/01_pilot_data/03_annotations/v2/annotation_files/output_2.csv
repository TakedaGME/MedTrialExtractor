It has single - agent activity against myeloma in vivo , inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells via multiple pathways , including inhibition of proteasomal degradation and the PI3K / Akt pathway [ 5][6][7 ] and importantly , by inducing endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress . In a phase I trial ( SAKK 65/08 ) 8 we showed that nelfinavir inhibited proteasome activity and significantly upregulated the expression of proteins related to the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PMBC ) . This key modulator of protein production , folding and destruction 9,10 , also determines proteasome inhibitor sensitivity . Combination of nelfinavir with bortezomib further induced the UPR and overcame proteasome inhibitor resistance 8 . A subsequent phase II trial ( SAKK 39/13 ) demonstrated promising clinical activity of a nelfinavir - bortezomib - dexamethasone combination , with an unprecedented overall response rate of 65 % in heavily pretreated , proteasome inhibitor - refractory MM patients 11 . Preclinical data indicate that nelfinavir was able to overcome resistance to the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib via modulation of multidrug resistance ( MDR ) efflux pumps such as ABCB1 ( ref . 12 ) . As lenalidomide is a substrate of the same pump family 12 , and via binding to the E3 ligase cereblon , works on the ubiquitin - proteasome system , we postulated that nelfinavir might likewise be able to overcome resistance to immunomodulatory drugs .",Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,04e8609a-4dc5-46b2-af03-dbc036fd6ab9,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Therefore , therapies that stimulate the immune system can benefit patients , both early in their disease course and after relapse ( Kumar & Anderson , 2016;Guillerey et al , 2016 ) . Pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent that exerts potent direct tumoricidal and immune - stimulating effects through binding to its target cereblon , a protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex , and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos ( Lopez - Girona et al , 2012;Bjorklund et al , 2015 ) . Compared with lenalidomide , pomalidomide has increased potency against cereblon , different substrate degradation kinetics , and a distinct gene activation profile , and thus , pomalidomide has antitumor and immune stimulating properties distinct from those of lenalidomide ( Lopez - Girona et al , 2012;Bjorklund et al , 2015;Ocio et al , 2015;Sehgal et al , 2015 ) . Pomalidomide also has activity in lenalidomide - resistant cell lines and animal models , and pomalidomide - based therapy has exhibited efficacy in patients refractory to lenalidomide in clinical trials ( Lopez - Girona et al , 2012;Leleu et al , 2013;San Miguel et al , 2013;Richardson et al , 2014;Ocio et al , 2015;Rychak et al , 2016;Dimopoulos et al , 2016a ) .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,0dcecd3e-9245-43f1-a76f-e40ce2fc3146,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Once a patient with metastatic CRC has experienced progression on first and second - line chemotherapy and biological therapies , the survival benefit of remaining therapies is limited [ 2,3 ] . In addition , therapeutic options may be constrained by patient comorbidities , age , or performance status . Novel therapeutic regimens are needed that are both tolerable and provide meaningful clinical benefit . Ziv - aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein containing portions of the extracellular domains of VEGFR1 ( also known as Flt-1 ) and VEGFR2 ( also known as KDR or Flk-1 ) . Ziv - aflibercept binds vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A , VEGF - B , and placental growth factor ( PlGF ) , thereby inhibiting VEGF - mediated angiogenesis [ 4 ] . Ziv - aflibercept is approved by the United Stated Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) for use in combination with Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , leucovorin , and irinotecan ( FOLFIRI ) for the second line treatment of metastatic CRC [ 5 ] .

Prior studies combining capecitabine with the anti - VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab have shown that the combination is clinically active and tolerable , even among patients with advanced age or comorbidities [ 14,15 ] . Since anti - VEGF therapies are active for patients with metastatic CRC in the first - line [ 16 ] , second - line [ 17,18 ] , and beyond [ 2 ] , we hypothesized that the combination of capecitabine and ziv - aflibercept would be tolerable , and would exceed the PFS of historical controls .",Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,fe8f82d8-f57a-4de5-a46f-a15346456d5d,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Mesothelioma secretes high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and utilizes the platelet - derived growth factor and receptor ( PDGF/ PDGFR ) pathway for autocrine growth stimulation . [ 2][3][4 ] PDGFR inhibition increases chemotherapy uptake into tumor cells via pericyte manipulation and decreased interstitial fluid pressure . 5,6 These factors suggest that the angiogenic pathway is clinically relevant and that targeting both VEGF and PDGF with systemic chemotherapy may be beneficial .",INTRODUCTION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,4e65d377-e3d8-4351-804e-93ef22b74193,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Southwest Oncology Group trial SWOG 0509 reported a 9 % response rate and 34 % disease stabilization with cediranib in patients with previously treated mesothelioma . 10 We theorized that targeting VEGFR and PDGFR would enhance chemotherapy efficacy and potentially bypass resistance mechanisms of high VEGF ligand secretion . 11 SWOG 0905 was thus designed as a phase I and II front - line trial . The phase I trial established the maximum tolerated dose of cediranib at 20 mg per day when combined with cisplatin - pemetrexed . 12 Median RECIST v1.1 PFS was 12.8 months , median modified RECIST ( mRECIST ) PFS was 8.6 months , and median overall survival ( OS ) was 16.2 months . 12 Here , we report the results of the randomized phase II SWOG 0905 trial .",INTRODUCTION,,,"162,168",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,db15abb4-036e-404b-9eb4-4c5e3b96dfae,study_type,,,,,"162,168",randomized phase II SWOG 0905 trial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Nonetheless , the 5-year survival rate in mCRC patients remains poor ( Siegel et al . , 2017 ) . The large variability in survival shows that current routine prognostic evaluation of mCRC is insufficient and needs to be improved , for both resectable and nonresectable metastases .

Mutant allele fractions ( MAFs ) are a measure of the percentage of mutant alleles within the totality of alleles in any given sample . MAF estimations of driver genes have shown important clinical implications in various settings . In a retrospective analysis of the CRYSTAL trial ( Van Cutsem et al . , 2011 ) , mCRC patients with tumor RAS MAFs between 0.1 % and < 5 % were more likely to benefit from the addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI . Likewise , resistance to anti - EGFR therapies in mCRC with KRAS MAFs < 1 % ( Azuara et al . , 2016;Laurent - Puig et al . , 2015 ) and longer benefit with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy were associated with higher MAFs in EGFR - mutated lung cancer patients ( Ono et al . , 2014;Zhou et al . , 2011 ) .",Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,09bf3784-672a-489d-be7f-45a7e51733d4,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

The trial team agreed to update this analysis when there was a meaningful increase in the number of primary outcome measure events after further follow - up , expected to occur $ 3 years later . During that time , the Intermediate Clinical Endpoints in Cancer of the Prostate surrogacy work showed that measures based on metastatic progression could be used as a surrogate for survival in patients presenting with M0 disease , allowing trials in that setting to achieve increased power sooner [ 2 ] . Given the prognosis for metastatic and non - metastatic patients is now very different and that other trials of first - line docetaxel have kept metastatic and non - metastatic patients separate , the STAMPEDE team agreed that the long - term follow - up results would be analysed separately for these two groups of patients .",Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,d4e71189-852b-4d88-b07d-65d3669d0b54,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

However there is still controversy about patient stratification and selection for treatment . Metastatic burden sub - group analyses of the CHAARTED and GETUG-15 trials have led some to conclude that docetaxel should not be given as a first - line treatment of patients presenting with ' low metastatic burden ' disease [ 3,[9][10][11 ] . This represents $ 40 % of patients presenting with de novo mHNPC [ 12,13 ] . These were retrospective analyses of relatively small subgroups of these trials and a number of groups have not been persuaded by these exploratory retrospective analyses . Reflecting this uncertainty , major treatment guidelines offer conflicting advice about whether all metastatic patients should receive combination treatment or whether this should be restricted only to those with ' high - burden ' , as specified in the CHAARTED trial [ 11,[14][15][16 ] .",Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,bfabc8bd-058c-4048-84a4-afc33406fd1c,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

In recent years , several researches have suggested that preoperative radiotherapy and preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy may improve the overall survival ( OS ) compared to surgery alone in patients with head and neck cancer [ 4][5][6 ] . The advantages of preoperative radiotherapy or preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer include down - staging , increased resectability rate , etc . Further evidence from several phase 2 studies have shown that preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy provides excellent treatment outcomes by leading to a pathological complete response rate ranging from 35 to 61 % and an increased 5-year OS rate of up to 70 - 81.5 % [ 5][6][7][8 ] .",Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,640efff7-75b8-4635-9642-d988110fd744,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

All costs are reported in UK pound sterling ( £ ) , year 2018 values . When cost inputs were based on different years , they were inflated with the Hospital and Community Health Services Pay and Price Index and , after discontinuation of this index in 2017 , with the healthspecific subset of the consumer price inflation index [ 25 ] . Daily costs for acalabrutinib treatment were assumed equal to ibrutinib in the base - case and sensitivity analyses and varied through scenario analyses , testing for 30 % pricing premiums and reductions ( Table 1 ) . Costs for rituximab are only inflicted in the first six cycles of subsequent treatment , in accordance with its approved indication , and are based on an average body surface area of 1.9 m 2 [ 14 ] .
