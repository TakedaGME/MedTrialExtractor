9e6e9e40-4066-4551-9477-3a67d6be5c9f,Blagden-2020-Weekly platinum-based chemotherap,1,Paragraph 0,"ICON8 was an international , randomised , controlled , Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup ( GCIG ) , phase 3 study to evaluate weekly dose - dense paclitaxel - containing chemotherapy compared with standard 3-weekly chemotherapy ( carboplatin plus paclitaxel ) in patients with newly - diagnosed ovarian cancer . The study was prompted by the phase 3 JGOG-3016 trial in which weekly paclitaxel ( 80 mg / m² ) in combination with 3-weekly carboplatin ( area under the curve[AUC]6 ) was found to confer improved progression - free survival and overall survival when compared with standard treatment in Japanese patients with advanced ovarian cancer . 1 As there is increasing evidence of pharma cogenomic distinctions between Asian and white populations , ICON8 was designed to explore whether the survival advantage observed in JGOG-3016 could also be observed in a mostly European population with ovarian cancer . 2,3 Results from ICON8 have shown that weekly , dose - dense paclitaxel - containing chemotherapy conferred no progression - free survival advantage when com pared with standard 3-weekly treatment . 4 As a secondary endpoint of the main study , the effect on health - related quality of life ( referred to as quality of life throughout this Article ) was assessed during treatment and in follow - up .

Patients were also eligible for the trial if there was no plan for surgery or planned delayed primary surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy .

Endocrine therapies targeting the oestrogen receptor are an integral component of treat ment for oestrogen receptorpositive breast cancer , but resistance develops in almost all patients with advanced disease . Several resistance mechanisms have been identified , including alteration of the PI3K / AKT pathway . This pathway is altered in more than 50 % of oestrogen receptorpositive advanced breast cancers , most frequently through somatic hotspot mutation in exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA , encoding the p110α isoform of PI3K. [ 1][2][3][4 ] Less frequently , pathway alteration is induced by loss of function mutation or deletion of the negative regulator PTEN or activating mutations in AKT1 . PI3 K pathway alteration is associated with endocrine therapy resistance through ligand inde pendent activation of the oestrogen receptor . 5,6 Conversely , preclinical data show compensatory increases in liganddependent oestrogen receptor transcription following PI3 K pathway inhibition . [ 7][8][9 ] A rationale therefore exists for simultaneously targeting both the oestrogen receptor and PI3 K pathways .",Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"["""",""""]",,7d97eac1-70a5-4873-8379-3d4024ac0ec9,title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Validate annotation

Power calculations were based on the null hypothesis that the true 2-year PFS rate was 87 % , with the alternative hypothesis being that the 2-year PFS rate was 0.80 ( or less ) . For a planned total sample size of 90 , the null hypothesis would have been rejected if 18 or more patients had a tumor recurrence or death , with a type 1 error of less than 0.05 . A pathologically positive lymph node that was found on a neck dissection that was performed because of the results of the 3-month post - treatment PET / CT was not classified as a regional failure .
