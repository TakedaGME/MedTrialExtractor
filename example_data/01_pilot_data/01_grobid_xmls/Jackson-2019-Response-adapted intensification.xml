			<abstract>
				<p>Background Multiple myeloma has been shown to have substantial clonal heterogeneity, suggesting that agents with different mechanisms of action might be required to induce deep responses and improve outcomes. Such agents could be given in combination or in sequence on the basis of previous response. We aimed to assess the clinical value of maximising responses by using therapeutic agents with different modes of action, the use of which is directed by the response to the initial combination therapy. We aimed to assess response-adapted intensification treatment with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CVD) versus no intensification treatment in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who had a suboptimal response to initial immunomodulatory triplet treatment which was standard of care in the UK at the time of trial design. Methods The Myeloma XI trial was an open-label, randomised, phase 3, adaptive design trial done at 110 National Health Service hospitals in the UK. There were three potential randomisations in the study: induction treatment, intensification treatment, and maintenance treatment. Here, we report the results of the randomisation to intensification treatment. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had symptomatic or non-secretory, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, had completed their assigned induction therapy as per protocol (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone or cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) and achieved a partial or minimal response. For the intensification treatment, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to cyclophosphamide (500 mg daily orally on days 1, 8, and 15), bortezomib (1•3 mg/m² subcutaneously or intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and dexamethasone (20 mg daily orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12) up to a maximum of eight cycles of 21 days or no treatment. Patients were stratified by allocated induction treatment, response to induction treatment, and centre. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival, assessed from intensification randomisation to data cutoff, analysed by intention to treat. Safety analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN49407852, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu, number 2009-010956-93, and has completed recruitment.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The aetiology and progression of multiple myeloma are driven by the accumulation of acquired genetic events that affect clonal competition within the bone marrow microenvironment. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Tumour cell diversity increases as genetic lesions accumulate, and the disease progresses from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined signif icance to myeloma, leading to substantial subclonal heterogeneity at the time of diagnosis. Applying induction treatment designed to eliminate susceptible clones might provide selective pressure for the expansion of resistant clones, resulting in early or late relapse. Combination chemotherapies designed to maximise tumour cell death and eliminate resistant clones can improve clinical outcomes compared with singleagent chemotherapies. Depth of response has been identified as an independent prognostic factor, making the eradication of minimal residual disease an important therapeutic endpoint. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Strategies to deepen response after induction therapy include the use of autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (in those eligible) and the use of post transplant consolidation therapy. Although the optimal timing for achieving maximum response is unclear, in our previous study, Myeloma IX, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> patients with complete response before transplantation had better progression free survival and overall survival than patients without complete response, supporting an argument for early achievement of deep responses and the use of pre transplant intensification rather that posttransplant consolidation.</p><p>This association raises the question as to whether monitoring response during induction therapy and switching to an alternative chemotherapy regimen in poor responders could increase the rate and depth of response and improve clinical outcomes. This study is the first to prospectively evaluate such a response adapted approach to induction therapy for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The purpose of the trial was to determine whether treatment intensification with a bortezomibbased regimen improves progression free survival and overall survival in patients with suboptimal response after immunomodulatorydrugbased induction therapy, which was standard of care in the UK at time of trial design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research in context</head><p>Evidence before this study Potential strategies to deepen response after induction therapy for patients with myeloma include the use of autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (in those eligible) and the use of post-transplant consolidation. Although the optimal timing for achieving maximum response is unclear, we found in our previous study, Myeloma IX, that patients with a complete response before autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation had better progression-free and overall survival than patients with a less than complete response. This supports an argument for early achievement of deep responses and the use of pre-transplant intensification rather than post-transplant consolidation. Little data is available concerning strategies for deepening response in transplantation-ineligible patients. We searched PubMed (July 15, 2019) for trials examining a response-adapted intensification strategy, using the search terms "myeloma" and "intensification", without language restrictions, for clinical trials published before 2019 and excluding those relating to the introduction of autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation or those lacking response adaptation. We identified one previous phase 2 study reporting the use of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone intensification administered to eight patients who failed to achieve more than a partial response to two cycles of cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone induction therapy. Five (63%) of eight deepened their response. To our knowledge the strategy of early response-adapted therapy has not been previously studied in a randomised trial and we sought to investigate this in Myeloma XI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Added value of this study</head><p>We found a significant improvement in response and progression-free survival associated with the use of proteasome inhibitor-based intensification therapy for patients who achieved only a minimal or partial response to immunomodulatory triplet induction for newly diagnosed myeloma patients, although no difference in overall survival occurred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications of all the available evidence</head><p>Our results support the concept that resistance to initial therapy is based on the specific therapy used and can be overcome by switching to a chemotherapy regimen with an alternate mechanism of action. In the event of a suboptimal response to immunomodulatory agent-based induction therapy, switching to a proteasome inhibitor-based combination improved response and progression-free survival. Taken together our data suggest that if agents of several different classes are available and can be tolerated in combination they should be used together upfront as is now the standard of care in the UK. If not, agent class should be switched rapidly in the absence of a deep response with the aim of response intensification to prolong progression-free survival.</p><p>www.thelancet.com/haematology Vol 6 December 2019 e618</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and participants</head><p>The Myeloma XI study was a phase 3, openlabel, randomised, adaptive design trial with three rando misation stages (figure 1). There were three potential randomisations in the study: at trial entry for all patients to allocate induction treatment separately for those considered eligible or ineligible for transplantation; after induction treatment for those patients with a suboptimal response to treatment (minimal or partial response based on International Myeloma Working Group response criteria) to allocate induction intensification treatment; and at the completion of induction and intensification or autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (where applicable) to allocate maintenance treatment. This Article reports the results of the randomisation to induction intensification treatment.</p><p>Results of the induction and maintenance randomisations have been, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> or will, be presented elsewhere. The trial recruited from 110 National Health Service hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland (appendix p 15).  Eligible patients for the overall study were at least 18 years of age and had newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, based on paraprotein in serum or urine, bone marrow clonal plasma cells or plasmacytoma, and myelomarelated symptoms or organ or tissue impair ment. Eligible patients for the intensification random isation reported here additionally had to have completed their assigned induction therapy as per protocol (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexa methasone or cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) and achieved a partial or minimal response. Patients were excluded at trial entry if they had other previous or concurrent malignancies, including myelo dysplastic syndromes, previous treatment for myeloma (excluding local radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, and corticosteroids), grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy, acute renal failure (unresponsive to up to 72 h of rehydration, characterised by creatinine &gt;500 µmol/L or urine output &lt;400 mL per day, or requiring dialysis), or active or previous hepatitis C infection. The study was approved by the national ethics review board (National Research Ethics Service, London, UK), institutional review boards of the participating centres, and the competent regulatory authority (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, London, UK), and was done according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice as espoused in the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations. The study was not originally designed as an adaptive trial however good recruitment and the emergence of data on novel combinations led to trial adaptation. These changes were proposed by the Trial Management Group and approved by the independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee and Trial Steering Committee. The final study protocol is in the appendix (p 19). All patients provided written informed consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomisation and masking</head><p>Patients considered eligible for transplantation at trial entry were randomly assigned (1:1) to induction treatment with either cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexa methasone (CTD) or cyclophosphamide, lenalido mide, and dexamethasone (CRD). A computergenerated mini misation algorithm with a random element was used to avoid chance imbalances in six variables measured at trial entry:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">β 2 microglobulin (&lt;3•5 mg/L vs 3•5-&lt;5•5 mg/L vs ≥5•5 mg/L vs unknown), haemoglobin (&lt;115 g/L vs ≥115 g/L for men; &lt;95 g/L vs ≥95 g/L for women), corrected serum calcium (&lt;2•6 mmol/L vs ≥2•6 mmol/L), serum creatinine (&lt;140 μmol/L vs ≥140 μmol/L), platelets (&lt;150 × 10⁹ cells per L vs ≥150 × 10⁹ cells per L)</formula><p>, and centre (each centre is listed in the appendix p 15). Following a protocol amendment on June 28, 2013, and after the recruitment of 1512 patients, patients considered eligible for transplantation were randomly assigned (1:1:2) to CTD, CRD, or carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KCRD). A similar minimisation algorithm with a random element was used to avoid chance imbalances in the six variables measured at trial entry. These changes were made to add a new induction treatment research question to this adaptive design study and were approved by the independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee and Trial Steering Committee. Patients considered ineligible for trans plantation at trial entry were randomly assigned (1:1) to induction with either attenuated CTD or attenuated CRD. A similar mini misation algorithm with a random element was used to avoid chance imbalances in the six variables measured at trial entry.</p><p>Patients with a suboptimal response to induction treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to cyclophos phamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CVD) or no CVD. A minimisation algorithm with a random element was used to avoid chance imbalances in three variables: allocated induction treatment (CTD vs CRD vs attenuated CTD vs attenuated CRD), response to induction treatment (minimal or partial response), and centre. Patients allocated to KCRD induction treatment were ineligible for this randomisation.</p><p>Patients completing induction and intensification treatment (where applicable) and eligible were randomly assigned (1:1) to lenalidomide maintenance or obser vation. A minimisation algorithm with a random element was used to avoid chance imbalances in three variables: allocated induction treatment (CTD vs CRD vs attenuated CTD vs attenuated CRD), allocated intensifi cation treat ment (no CVD vs CVD vs not randomly assigned at intensification randomisation), and centre. Following a protocol amendment on Sep 14, 2011, and after recruitment of 442 patients under protocol versions 2.0 to 4.0, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to lenalidomide, lenalidomide plus vorinostat, or observation. A similar minimisation algorithm with a random element was used to avoid chance imbalances in the same three variables with the same categories. Following a protocol amendment on June 28, 2013, and after recruitment of 615 further patients under protocol version 5.0, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to lenalidomide or observation. A similar minimisation algorithm with a random element was used to avoid chance imbalances in the same three variables with the same categories but with the addition of KCRD to the induction treatment options. These changes were made to add and remove research questions in maintenance in this adaptive design study and were approved by the independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee and Trial Steering Committee.</p><p>All randomisations were done at the Clinical Trials Research Unit (Leeds, UK) by authorised members of staff with a centralised automated 24h telephone system according to a validated minimisation algorithm produced under the supervision of WMG. Because of the nature of the intervention, the study was open label and the allocated treatment was not masked from study investigators or patients. The funders remained masked to treatment results until data cutoff.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p>The dose, schedule, and route of administration of each drug included in the induction, intensification, and main tenance regimens are described in the appendix (p 3). Briefly, in transplantationeligible patients, induction therapy with CTD, CRD, or KCRD continued for at least four cycles in the absence of progressive disease, until maxi mum response or intolerance was observed. In trans plantationineligible patients, attenuated CTD or atten uated CRD continued for at least six cycles in the absence of progressive disease, until maximum response or intol erance was observed. Attenuated versions of induction included lower doses of dexamethasone and a lower starting dose of thalidomide. For all patients, bisphos phonates were recommended until progressive disease and thromboprophylaxis was recommended for at least the first 3 months of treatment as per International Myeloma Working Group recommendations. Growth factor support and prophylaxis for pneumonia, varicella, fungal infection, and tumour lysis syndrome were allowed as per local practice.</p><p>Transplantationeligible patients receiving KCRD pro ceeded to highdose melphalan and autologous haemo poietic stem cell transplantation. Patients receiving immuno modulatorybased triplets (CTD vs CRD) followed a responseadapted approach with induction treatment intensification: those with complete response or very good partial response (assessed according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria) proceeded to trans plantation in the transplantationeligible pathway, whereas transplantationineligible patients proceeded directly to maintenance random isation.</p><p>Transplantationeligible and transplantationineligible patients allocated to induction treatment intensification received cyclophosphamide (500 mg daily orally on days 1, 8, and 15), bortezomib (1•3 mg/m² subcutaneously or intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and dexa methasone (20 mg daily orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12) up to a maximum of eight cycles of 21 days in the absence of progressive disease, until maximum response or intolerance was observed. Full details of the dose reduction schedules are shown in the appendix (p 4).</p><p>For maintenance therapy, 100 days after autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation or once a maximum response was achieved for transplantation ineligible patients, patients initially received lenalid omide or were observed without lenalidomide therapy. Following a protocol amendment on Sep 14, 2011, and after recruitment of 442 patients, patients were allocated (1:1:1) to receive lenalidomide, lenalidomide plus vorinostat, or observation. After recruitment of 615 more patients, a further protocol amendment on June 28, 2013, allocated patients to receive lenalidomide or observation in a 2:1 ratio, and the lenalidomide plus vorinostat group was discontinued. Maintenance treatment continued until progressive disease in the absence of toxicity.</p><p>Response and disease progression were assessed on the basis of International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and reviewed centrally by an expert panel masked to treatment allocation. Adverse events were graded according to the US National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.</p><p>Adverse reactions were assessed at the start of each treatment cycle in patients receiving induction intensifi cation. Comparisons between randomised groups were not made as adverse reactions could not be collected for those allocated to no CVD. Serious adverse events were reported for all patients from the date of randomisation until 30 days after the date of disease progression except in the case of serious adverse reactions or second primary malignancies, which were collected for the duration of the trial. Comparisons of these events were made for induction and maintenance comparisons only. Paraprotein, serumfree light chain, and urinary light chain excretion were assessed at least every 2 months for the first 2 years and then at least every 3 months until disease progression.</p><p>Cytogenetic risk profiling was done by use of multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification using DNA and realtime PCR (rtPCR) using RNA, which were extracted from CD138selected plasma cells from bone marrow biopsy samples taken before treatment initiation. rtPCR was used to assess the expression of translocation gene partners including t(4;14):MMSET, FGFR3, t(14;16):MAF, and t(14;20):MAFB. Multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification was used to assess copy number aberrations by including probe sets at sites of the commonly deleted or amplified regions in myeloma (eg, at genes CKS1B on 1q21.3 and TP53 on 17p13).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>The data cutoff date for this analysis was Jul 28, 2016. The hypothesis of the induction intensification randomisation was that CVD treatment could improve progressionfree survival and overall survival compared with no CVD in adult patients with newly multiple myeloma. The overall study includes PFS and overall survival as coprimary endpoints for each randomisation. However, for the intensification element of the study only PFS was powered.</p><p>For PFS in the transplantationeligible pathway, the trial was designed to show a 9month increase in median progressionfree survival in the CVD group (median 35 months) compared with the no CVD group (median 26 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0•74) when a total of 361 progressionfree survival events had been observed. This calculation assumed the timetoevent was exponentially distributed and that recruitment would last 4 years with a further 4 years of followup, a twosided 5% significance level, and 80% power. A recruitment target of 476 patients randomly assigned (1:1) to CVD or no CVD in the transplantationeligible pathway was specified, allowing for 5% dropout. For progressionfree survival in the transplantationineligible pathway, the trial was designed to demonstrate a 6month increase in median progressionfree survival in the CVD group (median 14 months) compared with the no CVD group (median 20 months, HR 0•70) when 337 PFS events had been observed. This calculation was based on similar assumptions but with a twosided 5% significance level and 90% power. A recruitment target of 380 patients randomly assigned (1:1) to CVD or no CVD in the transplantationeligible pathway was specified, allowing for 5% dropout. No power calculations were specified for the overall survival endpoint and analysis was triggered by induction analysis. The trial was designed assuming 47% of patients would be eligible following suboptimal response in each treatment pathway. These assumptions and estimated outcomes without CVD were based on results from our previous study, Myeloma IX. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat, including all patients randomly assigned to either CVD or no CVD. The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of CVD therapy or those assigned to no CVD. For the coprimary endpoints, we estimated summaries of time to event per treatment group using the KaplanMeier method. We made comparisons between the allocated groups using the Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for the minimisation stratification factors, excluding centre, and stratified by treatment pathway, to estimate HRs and 95% CIs. Subgroup analysis was prespecified for the presence or absence of individual adverse cytogenetic abnormalities, cytogenetic risk status, and induction treatment. We did a likelihood ratio test for heterogeneity of treatment effect using Cox models identical to those used for the main analysis, with the inclusion of terms for the subgroup in question and the appropriate interaction terms. The reported test for heterogeneity for subgroup analysis corresponds to a one degree of freedom test for two category subgroups and a two degrees of freedom test for three category subgroups, etc. The number and proportion of participants in each response category was summarised descriptively and exact 95% CIs calculated using the ClopperPearson method. We summarised toxicity, in terms of adverse events, descriptively.</p><p>Posthoc exploratory analyses were the effect of CVD on progressionfree survival and overall survival within the subgroups sex, age, and disease stage according to the International Staging System. The proportional hazards assumptions were assessed by plotting the hazards over time (ie, the log cumulative hazard plot) for each treatment group, the methods described by Lin and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> were used to check the adequacy of the Cox regression model. Evidence was found to support a violation of the proportional hazards assumption in the progressionfree survival comparison. Posthoc exploratory analysis using restricted mean survival time methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> was used to compare PFS times in the transplantationeligible pathway. The parameter t* (ie, the area under the survival curve up to a time horizon) in the restricted mean survival time estimation, the expected progressionfree period in this study, was chosen to be 64 months, because this was the maximum followup for all patients in the study. Other values of t* were investigated for the transplantationineligible pathway.</p><p>Formal interim analyses were prespecified in the study protocol for response and progressionfree survival. A formal interim analysis was prespecified in the study protocol to ensure at least a 15% conversion of partial and minimal response patients to complete or very good partial response. The number of conversions was reviewed by the Myeloma XI data monitoring and ethics committee after one response in 19 patients who had completed CVD treatment, three in 50, and 22 in 200, with prespecified stopping criteria determined using exact probabilities for a Gehan twostage design with 95% power. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Additionally, at the last of these interim analyses, the possibility of an exceptionally large early effect of CVD on outcomes was evaluated using prespecified criteria of a 50% conversion or an increase in median progressionfree survival of 24 months compared with no CVD (45 vs 21 months; HR 0•47). To ensure an overall significance level of 0•05 was maintained, the O'Brien and Fleming alpha spending function was used with prespecified bounds of 0•005 for interim and 0•047 for final analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> The interim analysis was done and presented to the data monitoring and ethics committee on Nov 14, 2014, and the study continued without reporting the interim analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Of 3894 patients enrolled in the triplet induction element of the trial, 1217 achieved partial response or minimal response after induction therapy, of whom 583 (48%) were randomly assigned to CVD or no CVD in the intensification randomisation. Reasons for exclusion before intensification randomisation included withdrawn consent (n=302), ineligibility (n=37), proceeded directly to autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (n=62), proceeded directly to maintenance therapy (n=25), progressive disease (n=78), and death (n=130). Slightly higher attrition occurred in the transplantationineligible pathway than transplantationeligible but no difference in attrition between patients treated with lenalidomide or thalidomidebased induction was observed. The number of patients achieving partial or minimal response to each induction triplet entering the CVD randomisation were 200 (60%) of 333 in the CTD group, 167 (61%) of 276 in the CRD group, 118 (34%) of 345 in the attenuated CTD group, and 98 (37%) of 263 in the attenuated CRD group.</p><p>The induction intensification randomisation occurred between Nov 15, 2010, and July 28, 2016. 289 patients were assigned to receive CVD and 294 patients were assigned to no CVD (figure 1), of which 367 were enrolled in the transplantationeligible pathway and 216 were enrolled in the transplantationineligible pathways. Patient and disease characteristics were well balanced between groups (table 1). The median time from induction therapy randomisation to CVD randomisation was 5 <ref type="bibr">•</ref>    There was some evidence that the proportional hazards assumption was violated overall (p&lt;0•0001) and in the transplantationeligible (p=0•059) and transplantation ineligible pathway (p=0•0010), suggesting the treatment effect was not consistent over time. Outcomes were, therefore, further investigated using the restricted mean survival time method. This confirmed a significant benefit of CVD over no CVD in the overall population and in the transplantationeligible pathway. This analysis further suggested a significant early benefit for CVD in the transplantationineligible pathway, which was lost at later time points (full analysis is presented in the appendix p 2  Sites were asked to report adverse reactions for patients taking the CVD and serious adverse events in all patients. Serious adverse events are shown in the appendix (p 7). CVD=cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">table 3</ref>). Most events were mildtomoderate in severity, with small numbers of grade 3 or higher adverse events (table 3). Other grade 3 or higher adverse events of note were lung infections <ref type="bibr">(13 [5%]</ref>). Serious adverse events occurred in 103 (37%) patients during CVD intensification (appendix p 7), andd 58 (28%) patients had a serious adverse event related to study treatment. The most common treatmentrelated serious adverse event was infection, accounting for 42 (59%) of the 71 serious adverse events in the CVD group.</p><p>Subgroup analyses of progressionfree survival and overall survival according to baseline characteristics were  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study showed that additional therapy with CVD improved the depth of response for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with a suboptimal response to an immunomodulatory drug triplet combination, leading to marked improvements in progressionfree survival compared with patients not receiving CVD intensification but without any difference in overall survival. The depth of response was very good partial response or better in 42•6% (95% CI 36•8-48•4) of patients treated with CVD. Median progressionfree survival improved by 20 months in transplantation eligible patients (HR 0•50, 95% CI 0•36-0•68) and 12 months in transplantationineligible patients (HR 0•73, 95% CI 0•52-1•02). Overall survival did not differ; however, median overall survival was not reached in either group at the time of analysis and after additional followup this endpoint will be reanalysed.</p><p>The absence of overall survival difference might have been confounded by the use of therapy after relapse, for example, which was not prespecified. Outcomes in the no CVD group might also have been affected by subsequent treatment within the trial. Although progression free survival improved with lenalidomide versus observation in all patients in the maintenance randomisation, patients receiving no CVD appeared to have an even greater benefit than those who had CVD or were not randomly assigned <ref type="bibr">(</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> The benefit of CVD therapy in terms of progressionfree survival was consistent across subgroups and persisted after autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation in transplantationeligible patients. The response rates after transplantation for the CVD and no CVD patients show that autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation alone can improve suboptimal initial response, but this can be significantly further improved by the use of pretransplant intensifi cation. The beneficial effect of CVD intensification on PFS appeared to be independent of cytogenetic risk status assessed centrally (with central results not fed back to local centres). These results are consistent with previous studies that suggest an additional benefit for proteasome inhibition particularly in the t <ref type="bibr">(4;14)</ref> or del(17p) subsets of disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Statistically, evidence suggested that the hazard for not receiving CVD was not constant over time and, therefore, that the proportional hazards assumption was violated. This effect appeared more marked in the transplantation ineligible pathway. Therefore, as prespecified in the statistical analysis plan, the restricted mean survival time method was used to confirm the results from the Cox regression analysis. This analysis confirmed the progressionfree survival benefit associated with early exposure to CVD in transplantationineligible patients, possibly reflecting the effects of subsequent and later line therapies in this patient subgroup.</p><p>From a biological perspective, our results are consistent with the concept that resistance to initial therapy is based on the specific therapy used. This resistance can be overcome by switching to a chemotherapy regimen with an alternate mechanism of action. We found that the adverse prognostic effect of poor initial response can be overcome and is not an inherent feature of the cancer itself but rather of the therapy administered. Analysis of patients within the trial achieving stable disease or progressive disease to immunomodulatory triplet induction who all received CVD intensification will explore this concept further and will be published separately. Additionally, in longterm followup, we plan to investigate the differences between achieving complete response or very good partial response to initial induction in contrast to only achieving it after CVD intensification. Minimal residual disease analysis was also done and this data will be presented separately.</p><p>In contrast to our use of induction intensification, two studies have examined the use of posttransplant consolidation. In the Stamina BMT CTN 0702 study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> patients were treated with initial therapy at investigators discretion followed by randomisation before autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation to one of three strategies: transplantation followed by lenalidomide maintenance, two autologous stem cell transplants followed by lenalidomide maintenance, or transplantation followed by posttransplant consolidation with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRD) and then by lenalidomide maintenance. No difference in progression free survival or overall survival was identified between randomisation groups. In the EMN02 study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> patients were enrolled before commencing treatment and treated with four cycles of CVD induction before being randomly assigned to autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (one or two transplants depending on centre) or four cycles of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisolone. There was a subsequent randomisation between two cycles of VRD or no consolidation. All patients received lenalidomide maintenance. In this study, posttransplant VRD consolidation before lena lidomide main tenance improved progressionfree survival compared with maintenance alone (HR 0•78; p=0•045). The preliminary overall survival results indicated comparable 3year overall survival with (86%) and without consolidation (87%). One of the key differences between studies was the initial induction therapy administered. In Stamina BMT CTN 0702, maximum response to induction therapy was more likely to have been achieved before autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation due to a lack of fixed duration of induction therapy. Similar to our study, patients had a median of 5 months (range 2-14 months) between initial therapy and registration and around 15% of patients had received more than one previous regimen, suggesting therapy changes in patients with a suboptimal initial response. In contrast, patients in EMN02 received a fixed four cycles of CVD given in 21day cycles, equating to 3 months of therapy. Taken together, these two studies support the conclusions of our study and suggest that maximising treatment response, either before or after transplant, is an important endpoint of therapy.</p><p>One limitation of the Myeloma XI study might be the induction regimens used, CRD or CTD combinations followed by a proteasomeinhibitorbased intensification regimen. The trial was designed in this manner owing to the UK standard of care at the time with no access to bortezomib either alone or in combination with immunomodulatory drugs. However, the outcomes for patients in the Myeloma XI trial do not substantially differ from other novel combinations. In the IFM 2009 study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> 700 transplantationeligible patients were randomly assigned to either three cycles of VRD followed by autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation and two cycles of VRD or VRD for eight cycles without autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation. The study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> supported the use of upfront autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, with the median progressionfree survival being longer for patients who received RVD and transplantation compared with those who received RVD alone (50 vs 36 months, HR 0•65, 95% CI 0•53-0•80, p&lt;0•001), although overall survival was similar in both treatment groups. The results obtained in Myeloma XI are not dissimilar. For example, the median progressionfree survival from CVD randomisation (ie, not including the duration of previous induction cycles) was 48 months for those receiving CVD consolidation in Myeloma XI compared to 50 months from the start of induction for those who received VRD plus autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation in IFM 2009 (appendix p 8). VRD is not widely reimbursed outside of the USA, where the combinations used in this study remain pertinent. Furthermore, even in the setting of VRD, a proportion of patients do not respond well and so the findings of Myeloma XI would support personalising therapy by adding additional agents of a different class to induction in the absence of a deep initial response. About half of the patients in the Myeloma XI trial with partial or minimal response after induction therapy discontinued the study before intensification randomisation for various reasons and are, therefore, not included in the analysis presented here. These reasons included progressive disease and death, but also offstudy treatment. Although further details for each individual patient withdrawing consent were not collected, we believe these withdrawals might have been driven by investigator and patient discomfort with delivering intensification to patients with responses very close to very good partial response but not quite meeting it or, conversely, not delivering intensification to patients with a response of only minimal response to initial induction. The substantial number of patients not reaching trial randomisation supports the use of combination therapies upfront to maximise response and improve outcomes, and these are now standard of care in the UK with the combination bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone.</p><p>Taken together our data suggest that, in the case of suboptimal response to initial treatment, agent class should be switched rapidly with the aim of response intensification. Although patients who do not respond to the induction therapy might still benefit from autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> these data support the maximisation of response before transplantation, given that the depth of response is associated with improved outcomes. of the study, and grants and personal fees from Takeda, Glycomimetics, Sanofi, Celgene, Janssen, BristolMyers Squibb, and Amgen, outside the submitted work.
