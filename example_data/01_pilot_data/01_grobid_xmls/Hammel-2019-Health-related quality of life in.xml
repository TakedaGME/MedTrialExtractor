			<abstract>
				<p>Background: Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer often have a detriment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In the randomized, double-blind, phase III POLO trial progression-free survival was significantly longer with maintenance olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, than placebo in patients with a germline BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation (gBRCAm) and metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease had not progressed during first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The prespecified HRQoL evaluation is reported here. Patients and methods: Patients were randomized to receive maintenance olaparib (300 mg b.i.d.; tablets) or placebo. HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30-item module at baseline, every 4 weeks until disease progression, at discontinuation, and 30 days after last dose. Scores ranged from 0 to 100; a !10-point change or difference between arms was considered clinically meaningful. Adjusted mean change from baseline was analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures. Time to sustained clinically meaningful deterioration (TSCMD) was analysed using a log-rank test. Results: Of 154 randomized patients, 89 of 92 olaparib-arm and 58 of 62 placebo-arm patients were included in HRQoL analyses. The adjusted mean change in Global Health Status (GHS) score from baseline was &lt;10 points in both arms and there was no significant between-group difference [À2.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) À7.27, 2.33; P ¼ 0.31]. Analysis of physical functioning scores showed a significant between-group difference (À4.45 points; 95% CI À8.75, À0.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Pancreatic cancer is the 13th most common cancer and 7th most common cause of cancer death worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Patients often present with advanced disease with worldwide 5-year survival rates of 9%, reducing to 3% for metastatic pancreatic cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Median progression-free survival (PFS) with standard-of-care first-line treatments is around 6 months and disease progression can result in deterioration in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. As a consequence, patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer have reduced HRQoL due to high emotional burden, symptom burden (in particular pain, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhoea), and poor prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. When evaluating the best treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, it is important to not only assess survival, which is relatively short, but also ensure that there are no detrimental effects of treatment on HRQoL. Indeed, American Society for Clinical Oncology guidelines on treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer recommend that clinicians should proactively discuss quality of life issues such as pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite, which tend to be overlooked yet have significant impact on daily life, with their patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In the international, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III POLO trial patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and a germline BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation (gBRCAm) whose disease had not progressed on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy derived a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS from maintenance treatment with the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib versus placebo <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The aim of maintenance treatment is to prolong PFS, and ultimately overall survival, delaying the need for subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy. In addition, maintenance treatment should seek to preserve HRQoL, which may be improved following effective first-line chemotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. First-line treatment with FOLFIRINOX has been shown to improve overall HRQoL and lead to a decrease in some symptoms, including pain, for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A prespecified secondary objective of the POLO trial was to evaluate the effect of olaparib on HRQoL, specifically the adjusted mean change from baseline in Global Health Status (GHS) score using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30-item module (EORTC QLQ-C30).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient population and study design</head><p>Details of this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial have been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Briefly, patients aged !18 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma and a documented deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm were eligible. Patients had received !16 weeks of continuous first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer, although duration was unlimited as long as no evidence of disease progression was noted by the investigator at randomization. Patients were randomized in a 3 : 2 ratio to receive maintenance olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or matching placebo, initiated 4-8 weeks after the last dose of first-line chemotherapy and continued until objective radiologic disease progression (investigator-assessed according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1) or unacceptable toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Crossover to olaparib was not permitted during the trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study outcome measures</head><p>A prespecified secondary objective of the POLO study was to assess HRQoL using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Additional HRQoL data were collected using the pancreatic cancer specific EORTC QLQ-PAN26 questionnaire (data not reported here). These questionnaires are considered appropriate to assess the pancreatic cancer patient experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes a two-item GHS scale, five multiitem functioning scales, three multi-item symptom scales, five singleitem symptom scales, and a single-item financial impact scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Raw scores were transformed on to a scale ranging from 0 to 100; transformed scores are reported here. For GHS and functioning scales, a higher score is indicative of better quality of life whereas for symptom scales a higher score is indicative of more severe symptoms. A change from baseline of !10 points was predefined as clinically meaningful, based on the published literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Assessments were undertaken at baseline, every 4 weeks until disease progression, at discontinuation of study treatment, and 30 days after last dose. The primary HRQoL end point was adjusted mean change from baseline in GHS score. Best HRQoL response (improvement, no change, or deterioration), the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful change (defined as a !10-point change from baseline) and time to sustained clinically meaningful deterioration (TSCMD) were secondary HRQoL end points. A TSCMD event was defined as a !10-point decrease (GHS and functioning subscales) or increase (symptom subscales) from baseline (or a patient being too ill to complete the questionnaire) sustained at the next scheduled visit with no response of 'improved' or 'no change' in between the two visit responses of 'deterioration', or death. In addition to the GHS score evaluation, exploratory analyses of functioning scores (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social) and patient-reported symptoms (pain, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, appetite loss and insomnia) were prespecified. Results from datasets considered to be most clinically relevant (GHS, physical functioning, and symptom subscales) are reported here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>HRQoL data were analysed in the subset of patients in the intention-totreat population who had an evaluable baseline EORTC QLQ-C30 or QLQ-PAN26 form [patient-reported outcome (PRO) analysis set]. An evaluable form was defined as one on which at least one subscale baseline score could be determined. For the adjusted mean change from baseline in GHS score analysis, only visits with at least 25% non-missing values in each treatment arm were included; study treatment discontinuation and 30 days following last dose of study treatment visits were excluded. The analysis was carried out using a linear mixed model for repeated measures, adjusted for score at baseline, time, and treatment-by-time interaction to estimate the cumulative effect of olaparib versus placebo on GHS. Between-group differences were compared using adjusted mean estimates for each treatment group with a between-group difference of !10 points defined as clinically meaningful, based on published literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. A change of !10 points from baseline was also predefined as clinically meaningful <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. TSCMD was analysed by log-rank test [hazard ratio (HR) &lt;1 favours olaparib] in all patients with a baseline score !10 (GHS and functioning subscale analyses) or 90 (symptom subscales). HRQoL improvement rates were analysed using a logistic regression model [odds ratio (OR) &gt;1 favours olaparib].</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population characteristics</head><p>Baseline characteristics of randomized patients are reported in the primary manuscript <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Of 154 randomized patients, 89 of 92 who received olaparib and 58 of 62 who received placebo were included in the PRO analysis set; the remaining seven patients had missing baseline forms. HRQoL scores were well-balanced between treatment groups at baseline with overall high scores for GHS and physical functioning scales, and low scores for symptom scales (supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>, available at Annals of Oncology online).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire compliance</head><p>The overall compliance rate for EORTC QLQ-C30 was high, 100% at baseline and 96.6% and 94.8% overall in the olaparib and placebo groups, respectively, based on the PRO analysis set (supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2</ref>, available at Annals of Oncology online).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Health Status</head><p>Mean baseline scores for GHS were high compared with those from other metastatic pancreatic cancer trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; 70.4 in the olaparib and 74.3 in the placebo group (supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  S1A</ref>, available at Annals of Oncology online). GHS scores remained relatively stable over time for both treatment groups ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). There was no statistically significant difference in overall between-group adjusted mean change from baseline for GHS score [between-group difference À2.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) À7.27, 2.33; P ¼ 0.31] calculated across the first 6 months of treatment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2A</ref>). The median TSCMD for GHS score was 21.2 months for olaparib and 6.0 months for placebo (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.41, 1.27; P ¼ 0.25) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>. A similar proportion of patients in each arm reported improvement in GHS score: 26/89 (29.2%) in the olaparib and 13/58 (22.4%) in the placebo group (OR 1.43; 95% CI 0.67, 3.15; P ¼ 0.36) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physical functioning</head><p>Mean baseline physical functioning scores were similarly high in both treatment groups and improved over time (supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1A</ref>, available at Annals of Oncology online; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>). The between-group difference in adjusted mean change from baseline for physical functioning was À4.45 points (95% CI À8.75, À0.16; P ¼ 0.04) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2A</ref>). There was no statistically significant between-group difference in TSCMD for physical functioning (medians not reached; HR 1.38; 95% CI 0.73, 2.63; P ¼ 0.32) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref>). The proportion of patients with best HRQoL responses of 'improved' or 'deterioration' for physical functioning was similar between arms ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Analyses of role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning showed no between-group differences in adjusted mean change from baseline of !10-points and no statistically significant differences in TSCMD between arms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Symptom subscales</head><p>Mean symptom scale scores were low at baseline, reflecting a low symptom burden (supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1B</ref>, available at Annals of Oncology online). For the symptom scales of fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and appetite loss between-group differences were statistically significant in favour of placebo. For fatigue, and nausea and vomiting the between-group difference was &lt;10 points, whereas for appetite loss the between-group difference was 10.11 points ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>). There were no between-group differences in TSCMD for any symptom scores, except for nausea and vomiting, and constipation for which there were significant differences in favour of placebo ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref>).

Therefore, treatment should focus not only on prolonging disease progression or improving survival but should also consider preserving or improving quality of life, because symptoms such as fatigue, pain, appetite and weight loss, and decreased functional status all have a detrimental impact on HRQoL for patients with this disease.</p><p>Patients were randomized into the POLO study following a minimum of 4 months of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (although there was no maximum limit to the duration of platinum-based treatment) and patients whose disease had progressed during first-line chemotherapy were not eligible for this maintenance trial. With the exception of alopecia, peripheral neuropathy and anaemia, toxic effects from previous treatments must have resolved to grade 1 before randomization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The majority of patients (84%) had received variants of FOLFIRINOX, which is known to significantly improve GHS over the first 6 months of treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>; in the seminal phase III study FOLFIRINOX improved mean GHS score from 53.8 at baseline to 68.3 at the end of 6 months of treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. It is therefore not surprising that patients in the POLO study had consistently higher baseline GHS and physical functioning scores and lower symptom severity than the general population of patients with gastrointestinal cancers, reflecting low disease burden following first-line chemotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The mean GHS score was 70.4 in the olaparib arm at baseline, consistent with expectations based on FOLFIRINOX data. Preservation of HRQoL is a major therapeutic goal in the maintenance setting and further improvement in comparison with placebo may not be expected. Furthermore, standard-of-care chemotherapy agents are often associated with cumulative treatment-emergent toxicities that further affect HRQoL and a potential decrease in GHS has been observed when FOLFIRINOX treatment is continued beyond 6 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. High baseline GHS scores in the POLO study were preserved with olaparib maintenance treatment and the primary HRQoL end point (adjusted mean change from baseline) showed no statistically significant or clinically meaningful difference between the olaparib and placebo groups. Furthermore, median TSCMD was longer in the olaparib (21.2 months) than the placebo group (6.0 months), although this difference was not statistically significant. This result may be influenced by a higher degree of censoring and smaller number of assessable patients (reflective of earlier disease progression) in the placebo arm compared with the olaparib arm. In addition, the proportion of patients with improved GHS score was similar in the olaparib (29.2%) and placebo groups <ref type="bibr">(22.4%)</ref>.</p><p>Evaluation of the physical functioning subscale indicated a significant between-group difference in adjusted mean change from baseline, favouring placebo; however, this difference was not considered to be clinically meaningful based on the 10-point change  points was considered to be clinically meaningful. For each subscale, only visits with at least 25% non-missing values in each treatment arm were included, therefore analyses cover only the first 6 months of treatment. Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals. *Between-group differences were considered statistically significant if P&lt;0.05. † For diarrhoea, N¼53.

In addition, there were no clinically meaningful between-group differences in change from baseline for symptom scales, with the exception of appetite loss, which showed a clinically meaningful difference favouring placebo. The notable findings in appetite loss scores appear to be driven by an improvement of these symptoms in the placebo group, since appetite loss scores remained low and stable over time in the olaparib group. Furthermore, appetite loss is a recognised treatmentrelated symptom of olaparib <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Lower symptom scores indicate reduced symptom burden and all other symptom scores remained low during maintenance olaparib treatment. A !10-point change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 score was predefined as clinically meaningful, based on the published literature. A study designed to determine the significance to patients of HRQoL scores showed that a !10-point change from   <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Time to sustained clinically meaningful deterioration (A) Kaplan-Meier plot for EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status and (B) Forest plot for EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status, physical functioning and symptom scales. Patients with baseline scores !10 were included in analyses of Global Health Status and physical functioning scores; patients with baseline scores 90 were included in analyses of symptom scores. Patients who had not had a TSCMD event or who had a TSCMD event after two or more missed HRQoL assessment visits were censored at the time of their last HRQoL assessment where the respective score could be evaluated; however, patients were not censored if they had two missing visits between two evaluable HRQoL assessments (and the outcome of the second assessment was not deterioration) and subsequently went on to show sustained clinically meaningful deterioration. CI, confidence interval. baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 score generally reflected a change in quality of life that was 'moderately' or 'very much' better or worse <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and was consistent with results from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials in various cancer settings, which demonstrated that a mean difference of 10-15 points in GHS score represented a medium effect size that was likely to be clinically relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. This 10-point threshold has been adopted for other studies based on EORTC QLQ-C30 data, including those in the pancreatic cancer setting, suggesting that it is an appropriate and generally accepted definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>; however, it is worth noting that at the time the POLO study was designed, there was no precedent for defining a clinically meaningful change in the maintenance setting.</p><p>In the POLO study, patients in the olaparib arm derived a statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS benefit compared with placebo and a trend towards increased time to second progression was observed, suggesting the treatment benefit may be maintained through subsequent lines of therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In addition, time to first subsequent therapy was significantly delayed in the olaparib arm <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Patients discontinued study treatment at disease progression and were only followed for HRQoL for 1 month after this point, therefore follow-up for HRQoL was considerably shorter in the placebo arm and the impact of disease progression, or any subsequent treatments, on HRQoL was not taken into account. Adjusted mean change from baseline analyses only included visits at which !25% of patients in each treatment arm had evaluable questionnaires; for the GHS analysis this equated to the first 6 months of treatment. This may mean that these analyses underestimate the overall impact of olaparib treatment in comparison with placebo, since disease progression and associated subsequent therapies would be expected to result in decreased HRQoL. Additional data assessing the psychological impact of having prolonged disease control (e.g. Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire or depression scale data) were not collected; however, the possibility of a positive benefit for this population of patients who had significantly improved PFS with maintenance olaparib may be considered.</p></div>
