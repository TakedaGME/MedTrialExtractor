			<abstract>
				<p>Ibrutinib, a once-daily oral inhibitor of Bruton&apos;s tyrosine kinase, is approved in the United States and Europe for treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The phase 3 RESONATE study showed improved efficacy of single-agent ibrutinib over ofatumumab in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL, including those with high-risk features. Here we report the final analysis from RESONATE with median follow-up on study of 65.3 months (range, 0.3-71.6) in the ibrutinib arm. Median progression-free survival (PFS) remained significantly longer for Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01578707.</p>

The PFS benefit with ibrutinib vs ofatumumab was preserved in the genomic high-risk population with del(17p), TP53 mutation, del(11q), and/or unmutated IGHV status (median PFS 44.1 vs 8.0 months; HR: 0.110; 95% CI: 0.080-0.152), which represented 82% of patients. Overall response rate with ibrutinib was 91% (complete response/complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery, 11%). Overall survival, censored for crossover, was better with ibrutinib than ofatumumab (HR: 0.639; 95% CI: 0.418-0.975). With up to 71 months (median 41 months) of ibrutinib therapy, the safety profile remained consistent with prior reports; cumulatively, all-grade (grade ≥3) hypertension and atrial fibrillation occurred in 21% (9%) and 12% (6%) of patients, respectively. Only 16% discontinued ibrutinib because of adverse events (AEs). These long-term results confirm the robust efficacy of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL irrespective of high-risk clinical or genomic features, with no unexpected AEs. This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01578707).</p></div>

Ibrutinib, a first-in-class, once-daily, covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK; a B-cell receptor signaling kinase expressed by various hematopoietic cells, B-cell lymphomas, and leukemias), was one such therapy introduced in this relapsed and refractory CLL/SLL population that has since revolutionized therapy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> RESONATE was the first multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 study that compared ibrutinib to ofatumumab treatment outcomes in previously treated patients with CLL/SLL, leading to full FDA approval of ibrutinib (after prior accelerated approval), including in patients with del(17p). The analysis from the first report of this trial demonstrated that ibrutinib significantly improved PFS, OS, and overall response rates (ORR) compared with ofatumumab and was generally well tolerated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> RESONATE was also the first randomized trial that identified adverse events (AEs) associated with ibrutinib, such as atrial fibrillation and bruising, that have been followed long-term with BTK inhibitors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">| Patients</head><p>Detailed eligibility criteria have been previously published. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Briefly, patients with active relapsed/refractory CLL or SLL with measurable nodal disease by computed tomography (CT) who failed ≥1 prior line of therapy and met the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 17 guidelines for requiring therapy, but were not candidates for purine analog therapy (see Supplementary Methods), were eligible for inclusion in the study. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each participating institution and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice.</p><p>The study was sponsored by Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, and Janssen Research and Development LLC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">| Study Design</head><p>RESONATE was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib compared with ofatumumab in previously treated patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL (clinicaltrials.gov number NCT01578707). Enrollment was from June 2012 to April 2013. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either oral ibrutinib 420 mg once daily (until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) or intravenous ofatumumab for up to 24 weeks at an initial dose of 300 mg at week one, followed by a dose of 2000 mg weekly for seven weeks and then every four weeks for 16 weeks. Stratification was by purine analog refractory status (defined as no response to or relapse within 12 months of last dose of purine analog) and presence or absence of del(17p). Based on durable responses in the ongoing pivotal phase 2 study PCYC-1102, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> a protocol amendment was instituted in August 2013 to allow patients on the ofatumumab arm to cross over to receive ibrutinib. Following study closure, eligible patients could continue to receive ibrutinib treatment in a long-term extension study (PCYC-1145-LT; clinicaltrials.gov number NCT03229200). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">| Statistical methods</head><p>Long-term efficacy, including PFS, OS, and ORR, were assessed in the intent-to-treat population.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">| Overall survival</head><p>With up to 6 years of post-randomization follow-up, median OS was 67.7 months (95% CI: 61.0-NE) in the ibrutinib arm and 65.1 months (95% CI: 50.6-NE) in the ofatumumab arm, irrespective of the extensive (68%) crossover to ibrutinib (HR: 0.810; 95% CI: 0.602-1.091) ( <ref type="figure">Figure S4A</ref>). To compare OS outcomes between treatment arms accounting for the extensive crossover from ofatumumab to ibrutinib treatment, OS was analyzed with censoring at time of crossover and was better among patients initially assigned to ibrutinib than to ofatumumab (HR: 0.639; 95% CI: 0.418-0.975) ( <ref type="figure">Figure S4B</ref>   and lung infection (4%).

Consistent with findings reported with earlier RESO-NATE follow-up, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> the subset of ibrutinib-treated patients with both del(17p) and TP53 mutation trended to have shorter PFS relative to patients without either of these high-risk features. In contrast to the earlier report from RESONATE, PFS outcomes in patients with either del(17p) or TP53 mutation (but not both) were similar to that of patients with both del(17p) and TP53 mutation.</p><p>The small number of patients in these subgroups and the retrospective genetic/molecular analysis defining many of the subgroups may be potential limitations in the interpretation of these results. Development of acquired mutations in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway has been observed in patients relapsing during ibrutinib treatment and together with other as yet undefined mechanisms contributing to relapse may be associated with unstable genomes. Answers to these questions are being actively pursued in ongoing studies.</p><p>Unmutated IGHV and del(11q) have an adverse prognostic impact on patients with CLL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> The negative impact from these markers has been substantially abrogated in the context of ibrutinib therapy, as shown in this study and other studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> This is confirmed by the current results from RESONATE in which patients with del(11q) CLL appeared to have no decrement in benefit from continuous ibrutinib therapy. This is reflected in the median PFS for this group (n = 50), which was 60.7 months and appeared to be longer than the median PFS of the overall ibrutinib cohort. In addition, median PFS with ibrutinib treatment was similar between patients with mutated and unmutated IGHV. Thus, our follow-up data suggest that IGHV mutational status and del(11q) have no impact on the long-term outcomes with ibrutinib treatment.</p><p>The ORR with ibrutinib remains high with longer follow-up (91%)</p><p>and was similar to rates reported with a median follow-up of 44 months (91%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> The CR/CRi rates have increased over time with ibrutinib treatment, approaching a plateau beyond 3.5 years (9% and 11% with median 44 and 64 months of follow-up, respectively). This is consistent with deepening of response with continuous ibrutinib therapy for responding patients and is similar to the improved responses observed over time with longer follow-up in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL in the HELIOS study and in the phase 2 PCYC-1102/1103 study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> Notably, the proportion of patients who reported clinically meaningful improvement in FACIT-F score was greater with ibrutinib than ofatumumab, and the improvement was maintained over time.</p><p>Assessment of long-term safety data is an important factor with continuous therapy, especially given the extended progression-free efficacy conferred by ibrutinib treatment. This update confirms that ibrutinib is well tolerated, and the prevalence of most grade ≥3 AEs of clinical interest decreased with each subsequent year of treatment, apart from hypertension, in which prevalence remained relatively consistent from year to year. During prolonged follow-up, the overall prevalence of treatment-emergent atrial fibrillation and hypertension of any grade were 12% and 21%, respectively. These rates were similar to those reported earlier in RESONATE with a median 44-month follow-up (11% and 20%, respectively). In addition, most of the patients who developed atrial fibrillation or hypertension had relevant risk factors for developing these complications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> It is important to note that the incidence of major hemorrhage with continued treatment was consistently low over the extended follow-up period. In addition, substantial proportions of ibrutinib-treated patients who experienced dose reductions or dose holds due to AEs were able to restart or remain on ibrutinib treatment (15% and 25% of these patients, respectively, remained on ibrutinib until study closure).

Over up to 71 months of treatment, commonly reported grade ≥3 hematologic AEs included neutropenia (25%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and anemia (9%). Commonly reported grade ≥3 nonhematologic AEs included pneumonia (21%), hypertension (9%), urinary tract infection (7%), diarrhea (7%), and atrial fibrillation (6%). Overall, 19 patients (10%) in the ibrutinib arm experienced major hemorrhage. The prevalence of any grade ≥3 AEs with ibrutinib decreased after the first year and remained stable thereafter, with rates of 62%, 48%, 46%, 46%, 48%, and 32% during years zero to one, one to two, two to three, three to four, four to five, and five to six, respectively.

Most patients who experienced atrial fibrillation had one or more relevant risk factors (22/24, 92%), such as a history of cardiovascular disease (10/24, 42%), hypertension (9/24, 38%), and/or baseline body mass index ˃25 kg/m 2 (11/24, 46%). Most received concomitant medications (19/24, 79%), including antithrombotic medications in eight of 24 patients (33%). The prevalence of grade ≥3hypertension was 4%, 8%, 7%, 7%, 8%, and 11% over years zero to one, one to two, two to three, three to four, four to five, and five to six, respectively (Figure 3). A total of 41 patients (21%) experienced hypertension of any grade (Figure S8), occurring at a median time of onset of 13.8 months (range: 1.0-54.0) and a median duration of 16.6 months (range: 0.1-64.5) for the events (Table S3). Most patients who experienced hypertension had relevant risk factors (28/41, 68%) of either a history of hypertension or related disorders (21/41, 51%) or a history of other risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, renal disease, smoking, or thyroid disease (19/41, 46%). Most patients who experienced hypertension were treated with concomitant antihypertensive medication during the treatment-emergent period (26/41, 63%). Other AEs of clinical interest with ibrutinib included peripheral neuropathy (all grade: n = 26 [13%]; grade ≥3: n = 1 [0.5%]), congestive heart failure (all grade: n = 9 [5%]; grade ≥3: n = 5 [3%]), and ventricular arrhythmia (all grade: n = 2 [1%]; no grade ≥3 events). Among patients in the ibrutinib arm, 17% (34/195) and 65% (126/195) of patients required dose reductions and dose holds, respectively, to manage AEs. Among the 34 patients with dose reductions due to AEs, eight (24%) ultimately discontinued because of an AE, of which 4 discontinuations (12%) were due to the same AE that led to dose reduction. Of the 126 patients with a dose held because of AEs, 20 patients (16%) ultimately discontinued ibrutinib because of an AE, of which 13 discontinuations (10%) were due to the same AE that led to the dose hold. The frequency of AEs that led to ibrutinib discontinuation remained consistent over time, and occurred in 6%, 3%, 4%, 4%, 6%, and 4% of patients during years zero to one, one to two, two to three, three to four, four to five, and five to six, respectively. Over the course of follow-up with a median treatment duration of 41 months, 32 of 195 patients (16%) discontinued ibrutinib due to AEs, including 11 grade 5 events of sepsis (n = 3), pneumonia (n = 2), unknown cause (sudden death, n = 2), lower respiratory tract infection (n = 1), lung infection (n = 1), cardiac arrest (n = 1), terminal bowel cancer (n = 1), subdural hematoma (n = 1), and serious burn and ensuing complications (n = 1).</figDesc></figure>

Reasons for discontinuation in these patients included PD (n = 22), AE (n = 3), and investigator decision (n = 2). Responses were observed in 10 of these 27 patients upon next-line treatment, including patients who had discontinued ibrutinib due to PD (eight of 22), AE (one of three), and physician decision (one of two). Next-line treatment regimens with responders were venetoclax single agent (five responders of seven treated), idelalisib + rituximab (two of six), high-dose methylprednisolone + monoclonal antibody (one of one, alemtuzumab), and investigational agent(s) (two of three).4 | DISCUSSIONTargeted therapy with ibrutinib for relapsed CLL has changed the natural history of this disease, as first demonstrated in the trial described herein. This 6-year update of the RESONATE study confirmed the robust efficacy of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL.The median PFS of 44.1 months in the ibrutinib arm is substantially superior to the median PFS in the comparator arm of ofatumumab (8.1 months) and to that of other treatments available at the time of study initiation. The efficacy of ibrutinib is confirmed in patients with Infections (combined terms) Major hemorrhage (combined terms) Peripheral neuropathy (combined terms)Congestive heart failure (combined terms) I G U R E 3 Prevalence of grade ≥3 AEs of clinical interest over time for ibrutinib arm (ITT population). Prevalence was determined by the proportion of patients with a given AE (existing event or new onset of an event) during each yearly interval. Multiple onsets of the same AE term within a specific yearly interval were counted once, and the same AE term continuing across several yearly intervals was counted in each of the intervals. Congestive heart failure and peripheral neuropathy were defined per terms included in the SMQ (narrow). Major hemorrhage (combined terms) was defined as any hemorrhagic event grade ≥3 in severity, or that results in one of the following: intraocular bleeding causing vision loss, need for a transfusion of ≥2 units of RBC or equivalent, hospitalization, or prolongation of hospitalization. Infections (combined terms) include AEs reported under "infections and infestations" system organ class category. AE, adverse event; ITT, intention-to-treat; RBC, red blood cells high-risk clinical and genomic features, including TP53 alteration (deletion/mutation), unmutated IGHV status, complex karyotype, and ATMaberrations (as shown by del[11q]). Analysis of OS is confounded by the high number of patients (n = 133) who crossed over to receive ibrutinib, with nonprogressing ofatumumab arm patients having the most indolent disease, and with ibrutinib use prolonging survival of the patients who crossed over. Despite this, when censored for crossover, OS was significantly improved in patients treated with ibrutinib although the difference in the median OS for ibrutinib vs ofatumumab was small (2.6 months). While a larger difference was observed using the RPSFT method, the analysis was confounded by the design of the study, which permitted early and extensive crossover, and the underlying assumption of this method that there is a constant risk of death throughout the study for both treatment arms. As expected, analysis of OS outcomes by timing of relapse suggests that patients who experienced PD earlier in the course of ibrutinib treatment (within the first one or two years) had shorter OS, as compared to those who experienced PD at any time in the first four years. Ibrutinib was well tolerated; the main reason for treatment discontinuation in this extended follow-up was PD rather than drug-related toxicity. The frequency and timing of Richter's transformation in ibrutinib-treated patients in the RESONATE study are consistent with emerging data from clinical studies with novel agents and historical data with chemotherapybased regimens. 20-27 Notably, the patient population in the RESO-NATE study was characterized by a high prevalence of factors previously identified as associated with increased risk of Richter's transformation, including genomic risk factors and heavy prior treatment burden. Most cases of Richter's transformation were identified early in the course of ibrutinib treatment, with almost half of cases occurring in the first year and all but two of the remaining cases occurring during years 2 and 3.</figDesc></figure>

The improvement in outcomes is evident in all risk groups, including patients with high-risk clinical and genomic features, and the safety analyses established that continuous treatment with ibrutinib can be delivered long-term to provide benefit to patients with CLL. </p></div>			</div>
