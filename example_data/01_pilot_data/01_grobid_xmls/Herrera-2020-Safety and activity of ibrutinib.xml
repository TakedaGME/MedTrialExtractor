				<p>This phase 1b/2, multicenter, open-label study evaluated ibrutinib plus durvalumab in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients were treated with once-daily ibrutinib 560 mg plus durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in 28-day cycles in phase 1b without dose-limiting toxicities, confirming the phase 2 dosing. Sixty-one patients with FL (n = 27), germinal center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL (n = 16), non-GCB DLBCL (n = 16), and unspecified DLBCL (n = 2) were treated. Overall response rate (ORR) was 25% in all patients, 26% in patients with FL, 13% in patients with GCB DLBCL, and 38% in patients with non-GCB DLBCL. Overall, median progression-free survival was 4.6 months and median overall survival was 18.1 months; both were longer in patients with FL than in patients with DLBCL. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) in patients with FL and DLBCL, respectively, were diarrhea (16 [59%]; 16 [47%]), fatigue (12 [44%]; 16 [47%]), nausea (9 [33%]; 12 [35%]), peripheral edema (7 [26%]; 13 [38%]), decreased appetite (8 [30%]; 11 [32%]), neutropenia (6 [22%]; 11 [32%]), and vomiting (5 [19%]; 12 [35%]). Investigator-defined immune-related AEs were reported in 12/61 (20%) patients. Correlative analyses were conducted but did not identify any conclusive biomarkers of response. In FL, GCB DLBCL, and non-GCB DLBCL, ibrutinib plus durvalumab demonstrated similar activity to single-agent ibrutinib with the added toxicity of the PD-L1 blockade; the combination resulted in a safety profile generally consistent with those known for each individual agent.</p>

The first patient in each dose cohort served as a sentinel patient who was observed for a period of ≥3 days to monitor for any unexpected acute or overlapping toxicities before dosing of the next patient. If two of the first six patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1, an additional three patients were to be enrolled. If ≤1 of six or ≤2 of nine patients experienced a DLT, the dose level was to be defined as the recommended phase 2 dose. If ≥2 of six or ≥3 of nine DLTs were observed, dose de-escalation cohorts (ibrutinib to 420 mg and/or durvalumab to 3 mg/kg) were available to be opened. In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients were treated at the recommended phase 2 dose as determined in phase 1b. In all cohorts, ibrutinib was administered orally once daily for up to 3 years in combination with durvalumab given intravenously on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for up to 12 cycles in the absence of progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.</p><p>This study was conducted according to principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, The study was approved by the institutional review boards, research ethics boards, or independent ethics committees of participating institutions.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as (1) any AE occurring after the start of study treatment and within 30 days of the last dose of ibrutinib or within 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab, (2) any study drug-related AE regardless of start date, or (3) any AE present at baseline that worsens in severity of frequency after the start of study treatment or is considered by the investigator to be study drug-related. Treatment-related DLTs followed guidelines provided in the CTCAE (version 4.03) and were defined as (1) any grade 3 or higher nonhematologic AE or (2) clinically relevant hematologic AE.  and white (90%) ( <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).

Despite this strong rationale for the combination of ibrutinib with PD-1/PD-L1-targeted therapy and preclinical evidence in murine lymphoma models for synergistic antitumor activity with ibrutinib plus durvalumab, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">25</ref> our phase 1b/2 study of ibrutinib 560 mg once daily with durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks met the early efficacy stopping rule. This suggests that the antitumor activity of the combination was similar to what would be expected with single-agent ibrutinib therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory FL and DLBCL.</p><p>In patients with relapsed/refractory FL, the ORR of 26% with the combination of ibrutinib plus durvalumab was similar to the ORR of 21% observed with single-agent ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory FL in the phase 2 DAWN study 9 and was slightly lower than the ORR of 38% observed with single-agent ibrutinib in a phase 2 consortium in patients with relapsed/refractory FL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">10</ref> Although the ORR of 26% with ibrutinib plus durvalumab was lower than the previously observed response rate in a phase 1 study of single-agent nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory FL (40%), 23 a subsequent larger phase 2 study of nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory FL demonstrated that the ORR was only 4% (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02038946). The median PFS of 10.2 months achieved by patients with FL on combination treatment in this study, in which almost 80% of patients were on at least their third line of treatment, was comparable to the median PFS of 1 year reported for patients with FL on their third-line treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">31</ref> In patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, the ORR with the combination of ibrutinib plus durvalumab was 38% for patients with the non-GCB subtype and 13% for those with the GCB subtype.</p><p>These ORRs are consistent with those previously observed with single-agent ibrutinib in a phase 1/2 study in patients with relapsed/ refractory DLBCL, which demonstrated ORRs of 37% in patients with the activated B-cell subtype and 5% in those with the GCB subtype. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">32</ref> The differential response rates between these subtypes is probably explained by chronic active B-cell receptor signaling, which activates the NF-ĸB pathway through BTK in non-GCB tumors but not in GCB tumors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">33</ref> DLBCL of the non-GCB subtype might also be expected to benefit to a greater extent from PD-1/PD-L1-targeted therapy, as high PD-L1 expression is only observed in non-GCB subtypes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">15</ref> While single-agent PD-1 blockade has demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, cell-of-origin analyses have not been conducted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">23</ref> In addition, despite the promising activity observed in initial studies, a larger phase 2 study of nivolumab in relapsed/refractory DLBCL demonstrated a response rate of only 10% (n = 121). <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">24</ref> Tumor mutation load was not found to correlate with best response Based on initial studies that suggested promising antitumor activity with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, we and others undertook studies to evaluate the safety and activity of anti-PD-1/PD-L1-based combinations.</p><p>However, subsequent studies of anti-PD-1 monotherapy have demonstrated that the single-agent response rate in FL and DLBCL is 10% or lower (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02038946). Unfortunately, despite a strong rationale and promising preclinical data, the combination of ibrutinib and durvalumab demonstrated similar activity to single-agent ibrutinib and was associated with the added toxicity of PD-L1 blockade, although the safety profile of the combination was generally consistent with those known for each individual agent. Thus, this combination does not warrant further study in FL or DLBCL. As PD-1/PD-L1 combinations continue to be evaluated in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it will be critical to understand the biological basis for response to those agents in order to identify target populations for further study. </p></div>

Tumor tissue PD-L1 expression was visualized via immunohistochemistry with Dako PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx kit (Cancer Genetics, Rutherford, NJ, USA) following the kit instructions, with high PD-L1 expression defined as ≥50% positive tumor cells. 27,28 DNA was extracted for genomic testing using a targeted next-generation sequencing panel, ACE Extended Cancer Panel for DNA (Personalis, Menlo Park, CA, USA), which includes more than 1400 genes involved in cancer biology and more than 200 cancer-related microRNAs to assess baseline tumor mutation load and characterize somatic variants. Depending on tumor tissue availability, between 1 and 2 μg of tumor DNA was used as input material for panel testing, which resulted in an average &gt;500-fold coverage over the extended DNA panel footprint. Tumor mutation burden was limited to mutations that resulted in changes in amino acids and was evaluated for correlations in patients with complete response (CR), in nonevaluable (nonresponsive) patients, or in patients with PD using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The pharmacodynamics of durvalumab were assessed through measurement of the reduction in levels of free soluble PD-L1 in serum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Efficacy and safety were evaluated in all patients who received ≥1 dose of any study treatment. ORR was evaluated as the proportion of patients achieving a best overall response of CR or partial response with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on exact binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson interval). Time to event endpoints were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Safety and tolerability were analyzed using descriptive summaries.The statistical design for both the FL and DLBCL cohorts in phase 2, including number of patients and responders, follows the statistical framework of Simon's two-stage design.<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">29</ref> To ensure adequate statistical power to determine a difference in ORR compared with singleagent ibrutinib for the phase 2 portion of the study, a maximum of 39 FL patients and 34 DLBCL patients (at a 1:1 ratio for GCB and non-GCB subtypes) were enrolled. Interim analysis was planned for the first 19 response-evaluable patients in the FL cohort and for the first nine response-evaluable patients in the DLBCL cohort.The response-evaluable population was defined as all patients who received ≥1 dose of any study treatment and provided ≥1 postbaseline response assessment. Cohort discontinuation was to be considered if there were ≤6 of 19 responders in the FL cohort or ≤1 of nine responders in the DLBCL cohort. However, assessment of biomarkers or tumor measurements could support continued enrollment. Enrollment continued while the first 19 FL and nine DLBCL patients underwent efficacy assessment. Enrollment was discontinued following interim analysis showing that stopping rules had been met. The primary analysis was considered the final analysis and was conducted after all patients had the opportunity to receive 12 cycles of durvalumab. The study was completed on February 5, 2018. 3 | RESULTS Beginning on May 11, 2015, 62 patients were enrolled, including 27 with FL and 35 with DLBCL (GCB, n = 17; non-GCB, n = 16; unknown, n = 2). The median age in all patients was 60 years (range: 22-82), with a median of 57 years (range: 31-79) in FL patients, 68 years (range: 22-82) in GCB DLBCL patients, and 67 years (range: 39-82) in non-GCB DLBCL patients; most patients were male (62%)</figDesc></figure>

In these patients, tumor mutational burden at baseline was not associated with best response status or maximum tumor shrinkage in either FL or DLBCL cohorts. In a small subset of patients with FL in whom tumor tissue was available (n = 11), baseline somatic variants in the HIST1H1E and CANT1 genes were correlated with increased tumor shrinkage (n = 11) (Figure S2). Additionally, the P21R single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TNFRSF13C gene was correlated with clinical progression in non-GCB DLBCL patients (n = 7). For all 41 patients with evaluable data, serum PD-L1 was suppressed to below the limit of quantitation starting within 10 minutes of the first dose of durvalumab and continuing throughout the dosing interval, I G U R E 1 Best response among patients with FL and DLBCL* (A) and duration of response among patients with complete or partial response (B).

At baseline, only one patient with evaluable response had high (&gt;50%) PD-L1 expression in tumor cells; this patient had GCB DLBCL and a best response of PD. One non-GCB DLBCL patient with a nonevaluable response also had high PD-L1 expression. No FL patients who were evaluable for response had &gt;10% PD-L1-positive tumor cells. Due to the small number of patients with high PD-L1 at baseline, the association of PD-L1 expression with clinical response could not be determined.</figDesc></figure>

The most common TEAEs were generally grade 1/2 (Table 2). Atrial fibrillation, arthralgia, and anemia of any grade each occurred in 10% of all patients. Grade 3/4 TEAEs were reported in 34 (56%) patients; the most frequent (≥5%) grade 3/4 TEAEs were neutropenia (n = 13, 21%), dyspnea (n = 6, 10%), fatigue (n = 5, 8%), atrial fibrillation (n = 4, 7%), peripheral edema (n = 4, 7%), and rash maculopapular (n = 4, 7%) (Table 2). One FL patient had grade 5 multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Serious TEAEs were reported in 33 (54%) patients; the most common (≥2%) serious TEAEs were atrial fibrillation (n = 4, 7%), and neutropenia, peripheral edema, pyrexia, cellulitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, muscular weakness, syncope, and dyspnea were reported in two patients (3%) each. Ibrutinib was discontinued because of TEAEs not related to PD in four patients (7%), including left ventricular failure, pneumonitis, peripheral edema, and autoimmune hepatitis, which occurred in one patient (2%) each. Durvalumab was discontinued because of TEAEs not related to PD in five patients (8%).

Further analysis with wholegenome sequencing or whole-exome sequencing would be informative for assessing global mutation load as it relates to response and tumor shrinkage. Baseline somatic variants in two genes, CANT1 and HIST1H1E, were correlated with tumor shrinkage in the FL cohort, and presence of the P21R SNP in the TNFRSF13C gene was correlated with PD status in the non-GCB DLBCL cohort. These correlations are based on small sample sizes and should not be considered true predictive biomarkers of response to the study regimen. These data evaluating somatic mutations associated with response are hypothesis generating, precluding definitive conclusion and requiring further confirmation. While the association of PD-L1 expression with response could not be determined in this study, recent work has demonstrated an association between expression of PD-L1 and CR in DLBCL patients treated with combination ibrutinib and nivolumab, an antibody to the PD-1 receptor. 34 The difference in results of the two studies could be attributed to potential differences in the mechanism of action of durvalumab and nivolumab (ie, PD-L1 rather than PD-1 blockade), differences in methodologies for PD-L1 detection and definitions of elevated PD-L1 expression, or other differences in study design. Further study of correlation between response and PD-L1 expression in FL patients may be worthwhile; however, the low antitumor activity observed with PD-L1 blockade in FL might make such studies difficult. Overall, safety findings with the combination of ibrutinib plus durvalumab were consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual drugs, with no new safety signals identified. The combination demonstrated acceptable tolerability at the highest dose level tested (ibrutinib 560 mg once daily in combination with durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks), with no DLTs observed. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the safety profile of the combination between the FL and DLBCL groups other than those expected due to disease type and duration of observation in the study.</figDesc></figure>
