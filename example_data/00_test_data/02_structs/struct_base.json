From March 2001 to January 2004 , a total of 28 heavily pretreated multiple myleoma ( MM ) patients were enrolled in this open - labeled , randomized Phase II study . Patients with refractory MM were randomized to receive either thalidomide alone ( 200 mg / day up to the maximum dose 800 mg / day , arm B ) or the combination of thalidomide and interferon alpha ( 3 MIU / m 2 subcutaneous injection 3 times weekly , arm A ) . The objective of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of thalidomide alone to combined regimen . The patients ' characteristics were similar between the 2 arms . However , the average treatment duration was significantly longer in the arm B than the arm A ( 236 days versus 101 days , p = 0.029 ) . Serum levels of paraprotein decline \u2265 25 percent were obtained in 6 of 12 patients ( 50.0 percent ) treated with arm B and 3 of the 16 patients ( 18.8 percent ) treated with arm A. The estimated time to event was 7.9 months ( 95 percent confidence interval [ 95%CI ] , 0.5 - 15.4 ) for arm B and 1.5 months ( 95%CI , 0.0 - 3.4 ) for arm A ( log - rank test , p = 0.0193 ) . The major adverse events in both arms consisted of neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia , constipation , somnolence , and skin rash . Our study showed that thalidomide alone was effective and tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory MM . The thalidomide combined with interferon alpha resulted in a lower frequency of paraprotein response , shorter treatment - duration and 25 percent of patients ' refusing rate . It may be concluded that the combined regimen is not well tolerated in our patients and needed to be further evaluated in the future . We are grateful to the support of the Hematology Society of Taiwan and Taiwan Clinical Cancer Development Foundation in conducting this trial .",

As the disease progressing , it will destroy normal bone tissue , causing pain and crowding normal hematopoiesis out ( 1)(2)(3)(4)(5 ) . The low incidence of complete remission , on the order of 5 percent , reflects the marked drug resistance of myeloma cells . Therapeutic intervention with cytokines is being evaluated in the management of a range of malignancies . Interferons have a broad spectrum of action on cellular proliferation as well as immunomodulation . In patients with myeloma , interferon alpha in combination with chemotherapy has been demonstrated to have synergistic anti - tumor effect ( 1)(2)(3)(4)(5 ) . Response rates of 20 percent were achieved when interferon alpha ( IFN - \u03b1 ) was applied as single agent for multiple myeloma ( 6 ) . A synergistic activity was observed when IFN - \u03b1 was combined with chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo , resulted in higher median progression - free and overall survival duration in the VAD ( Vincristin , Adriamycin , Dexamethasone ) and IFN - \u03b1 combination ( 7 ) .",

The recent return of thalidomide stems from the broad spectrum of its potential pharmacologic and immunologic effects ( 8)(9)(10 ) . The mechanism of thalidomide in treating multiple myeloma includes the possibility that thalidomide suppresses tumor necrosis factor - \u03b1 production , increases the body 's production of interluekin-10 ( IL-10 ) , and inhibits angiogenesis by preventing the growth of new blood vessels to support the malignant cells ( 10,11 ) . The combination of IFN - alpha2b and thalidomide had been reported to cause synergistic decrease in mean vessel count in tumors that were resistant to the antiproliferative effects of IFN - alpha2b and thalidomide in vitro and have potentiated antiangiogenic activity in a xenograft model ( 12 ) . Whether the combination of IFN - \u03b1 with thalidomide in patients who did not receive IFN - \u03b1 or thalidomide to treat their disease before can improve the response rate , duration , and survival were interesting to us . In this study , we will evaluate and compare the efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide alone or combined with IFN - \u03b1 in refractory MM patients .",

The results showed that the combination of IFN - \u03b13MIU 3 times weekly with thalidomide ranged from 200 mg to 800 mg did not increase the response rate in paraprotein level but decrease patient 's EFS duration . The combined regimen also increased the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicities , and other noticeable adverse events , that is , neurological toxicities , numbness of extremities ( 37.5 versus 16.7 percent ) , malaise ( 43.8 versus 8.3 percent ) , and dizziness ( 37.5 versus 8.3 percent ) . Similar findings also were reported in the study of Kasper et al . ( 15 ) . For patients receiving thalidomide combining with IFN - \u03b1 to treat their malignancy , it is hard to escape from this kind of toxicities . Nathan et al . ( 16 ) had used thalidomide and IFN - \u03b1 to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) and closed prematurely because of excessive neurological toxicities . The higher dosage of IFN - \u03b1(9 MIU 3 times weekly ) administered to patients might be responsible for the excessive toxicities in their study ( 16 ) . In order to decrease the treatment - related toxicities , it was highly recommended to decrease the dose of IFN - \u03b1 in combining with thalidomide ( 16 ) . Clark et al . ( 17 ) conducted their Phase II trial of combination IFN - \u03b1 and thalidomide as front - line therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and did not show promising response rate but one third of patients experienced toxicity and required to discontinue the use of thalidomide .

Although , their response rate was higher than ours ( > 25 percent M protein response 40.0 versus 18.8 percent ) , it was not superior to our or other study in the use of thalidomide alone ( 8)(9)(10)15 ) ( Table 4 ) . Whether the longer PFS duration in the use of thalidomide and peginterferon than ours ( 8.23 versus 1.5 months ) related to the novel form of interferon ( peginterferon ) and a different dosing schedule of thalidomide is still unclear . In their study , the used thalidomide dose was 100 - 400 mg per day in combination with peginterferon , starting from 20 \u00b5g and escalating to 50 \u00b5g per week . However , 7 patients had to stop the therapy of peginterferon between 3 and 9 months after treatment because of the side effects ( 15 ) . The overall withdrawal rate in patients treating with IFN - \u03b1 was from 10 to 20.3 percent ( 18)(19)(20 ) . The commonly adverse event of IFN - \u03b1 was mild flu - like illness and resulted in the withdrawal from IFN - \u03b1 therapy in some studies ( 6,7 ) . In our study , four patients refused to continue the treatment in arm A due to the adverse effects of interferon . The overall withdrawal rate to arm A was 25.0 percent , which was comparable to the results of others ( 18)(19)(20 ) . Concerning the overall tolerability in patients treating with arm A and B , it shows that the mean duration of treatment ( 236 versus 101 days , p = 0.029 ) and the total used dose of thalidomide ( 116.10 versus 40.36 g , p = 0.030 ) are significantly higher in the arm B.

Neutropenia was managed with dose adjustments , the administration of granulocyte colony - stimulating factor , or both , and thromboembolic events were managed with anticoagulants . Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was more common in patients who received lena- lidomide plus dexamethasone in our study than in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who received thalidomide plus dexamethasone or those with newly diagnosed disease who received lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in previous studies . [ 2][3][4]13 In our study , grade 3 or 4 infections were noted in 21.5 % of patients treated with lenalidomide , so future study of treatment or prophylaxis with granulocyte colonystimulating factor , prophylaxis with oral broadspectrum bacterial antibiotics , or both may be warranted . The low incidence of preventable grade 3 or 4 viral and fungal infections in our study does not support routine prophylaxis for these infections in all patients . Constipation and diarrhea , generally mild to moderate in severity , affected 31.4 % and 35.9 % of patients , respectively . Lenalidomide differs from thalidomide in that it is associated with a low incidence of grade 3 or 4 sedation , fatigue , rash , and neuropathy . [ 2][3][4 ] Our experience suggests that prophylactic antithrombotic therapy is warranted in patients who receive lenalidomide plus high - dose dexamethasone , although we did not test such a regimen . Grade 3 or 4 thromboembolic events occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide group than in the placebo group ( 14.7 % vs. 3.4 % , P<0.001 ) .

We measured , pre- , 3 and 6 months posttreatment soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor - jB ligand ( sRANKL ) , osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) , osteopontin ( OPN ) , markers of bone resorption and formation . Before treatment , patients had increased levels of sRANKL / OPG ratio , bone resorption markers and OPN , while they had suppressed bone formation . The pretreatment sRANKL / OPG ratio correlated with the extent of bone disease . Thal / Dex administration resulted in a significant reduction of sRANKL / OPG ratio , and bone resorption . Bone formation , OPG and OPN did not show any alteration . Changes of sRANKL / OPG ratio correlated with changes of bone resorption markers . Thal / Dex was given for a median time of 10 months and the median follow - up period was 22 months . The response rate was 65.7 % . The median survival was 19.5 months . b 2-microglobulin , type of response and International Staging System predicted for survival .

OPG is the soluble decoy receptor for RANKL and one of the most potent antiresorptive agents known . 13 In MM , the ratio of RANKL / OPG is increased due to an increase in RANKL production and a decrease in OPG production by stromal cells . 14 Furthermore , the ratio of soluble RANKL ( sRANKL)/OPG has been found to be elevated in the serum of patients with MM at diagnosis and correlates with the extent of bone disease and survival . 15,16 The possible presence and production of RANKL by myeloma cells may explain the major role of this pathway in the biology of myeloma bone disease as well as tumor growth and survival . 17 To our knowledge , there is no information in the literature regarding the effect of thalidomide on bone turnover in myeloma patients .",

Almost 23 % of patients ( 8/35 ) had achieved either a CR or PR with detectable paraprotein only by immunofixation . This response rate is higher than that observed with thalidomide alone 3 and similar or slightly better than that reported with higher doses of thalidomide ( 400 - 600 mg ) with dexamethasone , which ranges between 47 and 55 % . 8,9,24 In our study , there was no difference in terms of response among patients with relapsing or resistant disease , indicating that even intermediate dose of thalidomide may over - ride prior resistance to chemotherapeutic agents . Median PFS and OS were 8 and 19.5 months , respectively , comparable with PFS and OS reported by Dimopoulos et al , 8 who used higher dose of thalidomide ( 400 mg / daily ) and dexamethasone for refractory MM ( 10 and 12.6 months , respectively ) . These results suggest that intermediate dose of thalidomide is as effective as higher doses in combination with dexamethasone for refractory/ relapsed disease . The median time to response in our study was 11.8 weeks , slightly longer than that observed with higher doses of thalidomide , which ranges between 1.3 and 2 months ; 8,9 thus , the beneficial effect of intermediate dose of thalidomide may be delayed . Toxicities remained a considerable problem in our cohort of patients . DVT occurred in 11 % of patients comparable with that observed with higher doses of thalidomide plus dexamethasone . 9,25 It seems that the combina - tion with dexamethasone rather than the dose of thalidomide is responsible for this high DVT rate . The administration of LMWH allowed the continuation of therapy in our patients with no other thrombotic events observed , as suggested previously . 26 Four patients discontinued the study due to adverse events : two due to grade III peripheral neuropathy , one due to a cerebrovascular ischemic episode and one due to sinus bradycardia . Peripheral neuropathy is a well - established side effect of thalidomide , while symptom - related bradycardia seems to occur in approximately 15 - 20 % of thalidomide patients and arterial thrombosis has been reported in almost 10 MM patients who received thalidomide to date . 27,28 Bone disease is a major cause of morbidity in MM patients . Over the last few years , newly characterized molecules , such as RANKL and OPG , have been shown to play an important role in osteoclastogenesis in MM . RANKL expression is upregulated and OPG expression is downregulated in MM . 29 Our group has previously shown that serum sRANKL / OPG ratio is increased in MM patients , correlates with the extent of bone disease and reduced post - ASCT . 15,30 There is no available information regarding the effect of thalidomide and dexamethasone on myeloma bone disease .",

Furthermore , we found a correlation between both TRACP-5b and CTX with OPN . OPN , a noncollagenous matrix protein , is essential for osteoclast function , has been found elevated in newly diagnosed MM patients and correlated with disease stage and extent of bone destruction . 12,33 We also found elevated levels of serum OPN , confirming its role in the pathogenesis of myeloma bone disease . Bone formation was suppressed in myeloma patients before treatment , as reflected by the reduced levels of OC and bALP in our patients . It seems that osteoblasts remain functionally exhausted in patients with relapsed / refractory disease regardless of previous antimyeloma treatment as in patients at diagnosis . 34,35 Nevertheless , OPG was not reduced , a finding that could reflect either the effect of continuous biphosphonates therapy or OPG pattern of metabolism and excretion . [ 36][37][38 ] The administration of the combination of intermediate dose of thalidomide and dexamethasone significantly reduced markers of bone resorption ( CTX and TRACP-5b ) at both 3 and 6 month after the start of treatment . On the contrary , markers of bone formation and OPN had no alteration during this period of time . The sRANKL / OPG ratio was also decreased at 6th month . Changes of this ratio correlated with changes of both markers of bone resorption ( TRACP-5b and CTX ) , suggesting that the improvement of abnormal bone resorption may have been mediated by alterations in RANKL / OPG pathway . The role of zoledronic acid in the reduction of bone resorption markers is not clear . The antiresorptive activity of zoledronic acid in MM has been well documented . 39 However , it is very difficult to know whether zoledronic acid has any synergistic effect with thalidomide / dexamethasone on improving abnormal bone resorption , as we have not scheduled an arm with patients who do not receive zoledronic acid due to ethical reasons .",

Patients and Methods : Patients received bortezomib ( 1.3 mg / m 2 ) as an intravenous bolus on days 1 , 4 , 8 and 11 in a 3-week cycle ( twice - weekly administration ) , or on days 1 , 8 , 15 and 22 in a 5-week cycle ( once - weekly administration ) . Dexamethasone ( 20 mg ) was given on the day of and day after bortezomib treatment . Results : From January 2007 to July 2010 , 22 patients began to receive BD therapy . Initially , bortezomib was administered twice - weekly , but some severe adverse events developed ; therefore , from January 2008 , bortezomib was administered twice - weekly for the first two courses , followed by once - weekly for the subsequent courses . Patients who were expected to have severe adverse events beforehand were treated initially with once - weekly administration . Of the 22 patients , 14 were treated with twice - weekly followed by once - weekly administration , five with only twice - weekly administration and three with only once - weekly administration . Seventeen patients ( 77.3 % ) achieved at least partial response , including three with complete response and seven with very good partial response . The median progression - free survival and the median overall survival of 22 patients were 512 days and not reached , respectively . The median progression - free survival and the median overall survival of 17 patients who received at least one course of once - weekly administration were 615 days and not reached , respectively . The most frequent \u2265grade 3 adverse events with twice - weekly administration were gastrointestinal , especially paralytic ileus and constipation . Among seven patients who developed \u2265grade 3 gastrointestinal adverse events with twice - weekly administration , all four patients changed the schedule to once - weekly were able to continue BD therapy . Conclusion : Once - weekly administration of bortezomib in BD therapy may reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events without reducing the clinical efficacy of this therapy for refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma .",

As CR has been considered to be a surrogate marker of the clinical benefit of bortezomib ( 7,15 ) , our treatment approach planned to continue BD therapy until CR . After the schedule change to once - weekly administration , the incidence of severe gastrointestinal adverse events decreased and gastrointestinal adverse events did not prevent any patients from continuing BD therapy . No additional severe adverse events associated with long - term BD therapy were observed . The median number of courses of BD therapy was 8 , which was more than that of other reports . These findings suggest that continuous and many courses of BD therapy resulted in the more favorable clinical efficacy in our study . While PN often induced dose reduction or discontinuation of bortezomib , gastrointestinal adverse events were also frequent and severe . The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events in our study was higher than that in other previous reports ( 13,14 ) . This may have been because many patients with poor PS were included in our study . Although it is difficult to make a comparison because of differences in disease status or the general condition of each patient at the time of BD therapy , the incidences of severe paralytic ileus and constipation were less frequent with once - weekly than twice - weekly administration .",

Lenalidomide plus low - dose dexamethasone is effective and generally well tolerated in Caucasian RRMM patients , but no previous study has evaluated this regimen in Chinese RRMM patients . Methods : MM-021 is a phase 2 , multicenter , single - arm open - label registration trial conducted to assess the efficacy , safety , and pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide plus low - dose dexamethasone in Chinese patients with RRMM . Patients with \u22651 prior antimyeloma therapy received lenalidomide plus low - dose dexamethasone until disease progression or discontinuation . Follow - up of surviving patients continued for \u22651 year after enrollment . The lenalidomide dose was 25 mg / day , and was adjusted according to baseline renal function . Most patients had advanced disease ( 85.6 % had Durie - Salmon stage III ) and were heavily pretreated ( 56.7 % had received \u22654 prior regimens ; 69.5 % prior thalidomide and 63.1 % prior bortezomib ) ; 5.3 % had immunoglobulin D ( IgD ) disease . Results : The safety population comprised 199 eligible patients . In the efficacy population ( n = 187 ) , the disease control rate ( at least stable disease ) was 94.7 % , and the overall response rate ( at least partial response ) was 47.6 % . High response rates were also achieved in patients who had renal impairment and in those with IgD disease . After a median study follow - up of 15.2 months , the median response duration was 8.8 months ( range , 0.4 - 18.8 months ) and median progression - free survival was 8.3 months ( 95 % CI 6.5 - 9.8 ) . The most common grade 3 - 4 adverse events ( AEs ) were anemia ( 26.1 % ) , neutropenia ( 25.1 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 14.6 % ) , pneumonia ( 13.1 % ) , leukopenia ( 9.5 % ) , and decreased neutrophil count ( 8.5 % ) . AEs led to lenalidomide dose reduction and/or interruption in 40.2 % of patients , and treatment discontinuation in about 9 % of patients . The pharmacokinetic profile of lenalidomide was similar to that reported in Caucasian and Japanese patients . Conclusions : Lenalidomide plus low - dose dexamethasone was associated with a high response rate and acceptable safety profile in heavily pretreated Chinese patients with RRMM , including those with renal impairment and IgD subtype . These findings highlight the clinical potential of this regimen in Chinese RRMM patients who have exhausted current treatment options .",

The introduction of innovative therapies , such as proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs , has improved the prognosis for MM patients worldwide [ 4 ] . The Chinese Multiple Myeloma Working Group treatment guidelines currently recommend bortezomib - and thalidomidecontaining regimens for newly diagnosed MM [ 5 ] , although only bortezomib has been approved for the treatment of MM in China . As MM patients will eventually relapse or become refractory to current treatments , there is a need for new therapeutic agents to offer more options when this occurs .",

The combination regimen has been shown to be safe and effective in various RRMM patient populations , including those in North America , Australia , Europe , Israel , and Japan [ 6][7][8 ] . The pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile of lenalidomide does not appear to be sensitive to ethnic factors and has been reported as similar in Japanese MM patients , healthy Caucasian volunteers [ 8 ] , and MM patients [ 9 ] over the clinical dose range of 5 - 25 mg / day . In a study conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) in patients with newly diagnosed MM , 1-year survival was superior with lenalidomide plus low - dose dexamethasone compared with lenalidomide plus highdose dexamethasone [ 10 ] . However , the lenalidomide plus low - dose dexamethasone regimen has not been studied in patients with RRMM .

The rationale for using low - dose dexamethasone in the MM-021 trial was based on providing better tolerability while still achieving the synergistic activity of lenalidomide and dexamethasone as shown by Rajkumar et al . [ 10 ] in patients with newly diagnosed MM .",

Lenalidomide undergoes limited metabolism and has a predominantly renal route of excretion ; in patients with renal impairment the plasma concentration and half - life of the drug are significantly higher [ 20 ] . Therefore , it is important to use lower lenalidomide starting doses in this population . A subanalysis of patients from the MM-009 and MM-010 studies based on renal function status indicated that , even with dose reductions and interruptions , there were no differences in response rates in patients with renal impairment or failure as compared with patients with normal renal function [ 14 ] . A prospective study of 50 patients with renal impairment or renal failure has supported these results [ 13 ] . In the MM-021 analysis of Chinese MM patients with renal impairment ( including 12 patients with severe renal impairment ) a high ORR ( 41.7 % ) was achieved . These findings , together with previous reports , indicate that with careful monitoring of creatinine levels and AEs , as well as appropriate dose adjustments , lenalidomide plus low - dose dexamethasone is an effective and well - tolerated treatment option for patients with MM who have renal impairment .",

Overall , the main AEs in MM-021 were hematologic and were manageable by dose adjustment of lenalidomide . The most frequently reported grade 3 - 4 AEs were cytopenias and pneumonia , and consistent with safety findings from the global pivotal phase 3 studies . The incidence of grade 3 - 4 anemia was higher in this study than in the phase 3 studies , which may be a result of the already high baseline incidence of anemia ( 87 % in MM-021 ) , partly related to underlying disease characteristics . Importantly , lenalidomide was not associated with peripheral neuropathy in this study . As expected , the most common cause of death in MM-021 was MM or complications due to disease progression . The mortality rate and the primary causes of death were consistent with those expected for a population of patients with RRMM . The incidence of grade 3 VTE was lower than previously observed in phase 3 studies ( 11.4 - 14.7 % ) [ 6,7 ] . Only 1 patient in this study experienced a VTE event . This may be due to the requirement for all patients to take antithrombotic prophylactic treatment and/or the overall shorter time on study for patients in this trial . Some evidence also suggests that the risk of VTE may be generally lower in Asian populations compared with Caucasian populations [ 22,23 ] , including among patients with cancer [ 24 ] .",

Furthermore , the mean plasma lenalidomide exposure levels observed in Chinese MM patients who received the 25 mg lenalidomide dose alone were comparable to those historically observed in Caucasian MM patients [ 20 ] . Administration of 40 mg of dexamethasone had no effect on the multiple - dose PK profile of lenalidomide , as evidenced by the almost identical plasma concentration - time curves and similar values of the PK parameters for lenalidomide alone and lenalidomide plus low - dose dexamethasone . The PK data are also consistent with previous observations in Japanese [ 8 ] and Caucasian patients with RRMM [ 9 , Celgene data on file ] . In RRMM patients with normal renal function , lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed and eliminated , with no evidence of accumulation after multiple doses . Furthermore , plasma exposure to lenalidomide ( as evidenced by the AUC \u221e , ) was similar in the different MM populations [ 8,9 , Celgene data on file ] . The consistency of the PK profile with previous studies suggests that the 25 mg / day starting dose of lenalidomide should also be the same in Chinese patients as in other populations . With progressing treatment cycles , the daily dose of lenalidomide was remarkably stable , remaining at 25 mg / day in around 70 % of patients ; the 20 mg and 15 mg dose levels were infrequently used . Approximately 20 % of patients with renal impairment / renal failure started at a dose of 10 mg / day ( cycle 1 ) . In addition to the PK results consistent with previous studies , the efficacy results achieved in this Chinese MM patient population largely maintained on stable doses , which supports lenalidomide 25 mg as the appropriate starting dose for patients without renal impairment .

PN led to bort dose reduction to 1 mg / m 2 in 34/66 patients ( 52 % ) , generally at cycle 4 , and in 11 of these 34 patients a further dose reduction to 0.7 mg / m 2 was required , mainly at cycle 5 . Five patients ( 6 % ) permanently discontinued treatment due to painful grade 3 PN . Among 50 patients with grade \u22652 BiPN , 44 registered an improvement in neurological symptoms within a median time of 82 ( range , 14 - 311)days . Improvement was achieved by appropriately reducing the dose of bort and using supportive therapy ( gabapentin / amitriptyline and analgesics ) .",

Among these latter , the probability to improve / resolve PN and time to achieve this objective were consistent with other reports [ 15 ] .

METHODS In this phase 3 trial , we randomly assigned 569 patients with multiple myeloma who had received one or more previous lines of therapy to receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone either alone ( control group ) or in combination with daratumumab ( daratumumab group ) . The primary end point was progression - free survival . RESULTS At a median follow - up of 13.5 months in a protocol - specified interim analysis , 169 events of disease progression or death were observed ( in 53 of 286 patients [ 18.5 % ] in the daratumumab group vs. 116 of 283 [ 41.0 % ] in the control group ; hazard ratio , 0.37 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.27 to 0.52 ; P<0.001 by stratified log - rank test ) . The Kaplan - Meier rate of progression - free survival at 12 months was 83.2 % ( 95 % CI , 78.3 to 87.2 ) in the daratumumab group , as compared with 60.1 % ( 95 % CI , 54.0 to 65.7 ) in the control group . A significantly higher rate of overall response was observed in the daratumumab group than in the control group ( 92.9 % vs. 76.4 % , P<0.001 ) , as was a higher rate of complete response or better ( 43.1 % vs. 19.2 % , P<0.001 ) . In the daratumumab group , 22.4 % of the patients had results below the threshold for minimal residual disease ( 1 tumor cell per 10 5 white cells ) , as compared with 4.6 % of those in the control group ( P<0.001 ) ; results below the threshold for minimal residual disease were associated with improved outcomes . The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 during treatment were neutropenia ( in 51.9 % of the patients in the daratumumab group vs. 37.0 % of those in the control group ) , thrombocytopenia ( in 12.7 % vs. 13.5 % ) , and anemia ( in 12.4 % vs. 19.6 % ) . Daratumumab - associated infusion - related reactions occurred in 47.7 % of the patients and were mostly of grade 1 or 2 . CONCLUSIONS The addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone significantly lengthened progression - free survival among patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma . Daratumumab was associated with infusion - related reactions and a higher rate of neutropenia than the control therapy .

A phase 3 trial of bortezomib and dexamethasone , with or without daratumumab , met its primary end point at the interim analysis and showed a significantly higher rate of progression - free survival , with a 61 % lower risk of progression or death in the daratumumab group than in the control group . 18 A phase 1 - 2 study of daratumumab , lena - lidomide , and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma showed that this combination provided therapeutic benefits , no dose - limiting toxic effects , and an 81 % rate of overall response , including a 25 % rate of stringent complete response ( a definition of this term is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org ) . 19 At 18 months , the rate of progression - free survival was 72 % , and the rate of overall survival was 90 % . 19 Here we report the results of a prespecified interim analysis of a phase 3 trial of daratumumab , lenalidomide , and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma .",

This suggests that results below the threshold for minimal residual disease also should be a treatment goal in the context of relapsed or refractory disease . Cross - study comparisons should be interpreted with caution because of differences in study design and eligibility criteria . However , other studies that have aimed to improve treatment in the context of salvage therapy have been published . Two trials evaluated a proteasome inhibitor plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone , with a hazard ratio for disease progression or death of 0.69 ( median progression - free survival , 26.3 vs. 17.6 months ; overall response rate , 87 % vs. 67 % ) with carfilzomib ( in the ASPIRE [ Carfilzomib , Lenalidomide , and Dexamethasone versus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for the Treatment of Patients with Relapsed Multiple Myeloma ] trial ) 27 and a hazard ratio for disease progression or death of 0.74 ( median progression - free survival , 20.6 vs. 14.7 months ; overall response rate , 78 % vs. 72 % ) with ixazomib ( in the TOURMALINE - MM1 trial ) . 28 The ELOQUENT-2 trial of elotuzumab , a monoclonal antibody targeting signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 ( SLAMF7 ) that lacks single - agent activity , in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone as compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone showed a hazard ratio for dis - ease progression or death of 0.70 ( median progression - free survival , 19.4 vs. 14.9 months ; overall response rate , 79 % vs. 66 % ) . 29,30 Daratumumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was associated with clinically manageable adverse events that were consistent with the known toxic effects of lenalidomide and dexamethasone 27,28,30,31 and of daratumumab . 9,10 Despite higher rates of neutropenia in the daratumumab group , the rate of infection of grade 3 or 4 was only slightly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group ( 28 % vs. 23 % ) . The rates of treatment discontinuation owing to adverse events were low and similar in the two groups . After the implementation of guidelines from other studies of daratumumab regarding the management of infusion - related reactions , infusion - related reactions were consistent with daratumumab monotherapy 9,10 and combination therapy , 18,19,32 were mostly of grade 1 or 2 , and usually occurred during the first infusion .",

METHODS In this phase 3 trial , we randomly assigned 498 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive bortezomib ( 1.3 mg per square meter of bodysurface area ) and dexamethasone ( 20 mg ) alone ( control group ) or in combination with daratumumab ( 16 mg per kilogram of body weight ) ( daratumumab group ) . The primary end point was progression - free survival . RESULTS A prespecified interim analysis showed that the rate of progression - free survival was significantly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group ; the 12-month rate of progression - free survival was 60.7 % in the daratumumab group versus 26.9 % in the control group . After a median follow - up period of 7.4 months , the median progression - free survival was not reached in the daratumumab group and was 7.2 months in the control group ( hazard ratio for progression or death with daratumumab vs. control , 0.39 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.28 to 0.53 ; P<0.001 ) . The rate of overall response was higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group ( 82.9 % vs. 63.2 % , P<0.001 ) , as were the rates of very good partial response or better ( 59.2 % vs. 29.1 % , P<0.001 ) and complete response or better ( 19.2 % vs. 9.0 % , P = 0.001 ) . Three of the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the daratumumab group and the control group were thrombocytopenia ( 45.3 % and 32.9 % , respectively ) , anemia ( 14.4 % and 16.0 % , respectively ) , and neutropenia ( 12.8 % and 4.2 % , respectively ) . Infusion - related reactions that were associated with daratumumab treatment were reported in 45.3 % of the patients in the daratumumab group ; these reactions were mostly grade 1 or 2 ( grade 3 in 8.6 % of the patients ) , and in 98.2 % of these patients , they occurred during the first infusion . CONCLUSIONS Among patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma , daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone resulted in significantly longer progression - free survival than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and was associated with infusion - related reactions and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone .

The time to subsequent antimyeloma treatment was an exploratory efficacy end point . Definitions of these efficacy end points are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .

All responses , including progressive disease , were confirmed by a second , consecutive assessment . In cases in which a patient had a possible complete response but the investigator suspected that the patient 's dose of daratumumab had interfered with the quantitation of serum M - protein as determined by either the electrophoresis assay or the immunofixation assay , additional reflex testing with the use of an antiidiotype antibody was used to confirm the complete response . 20,21 Definitions of all response categories are provided in the protocol .

The rate of infusion - related reactions was expected and was consistent with findings from previous trials of daratumumab administered either as monotherapy 19,32 or as combination therapy . 15,24 In this prespecified interim analysis , no analyses according to baseline cytogenetic features were possible because the evaluation of these data is ongoing . In addition , because of the relatively short follow - up period , we could not assess whether the addition of daratumumab to bortezomib and dexamethasone confers an overall survival benefit . The final analysis of overall survival will be confounded by the treatment effects of daratumumab in the control group because patients in the control group were allowed to receive daratumumab after the interim analysis was completed .",

METHODS In this phase 3 study , we randomly assigned patients to receive either elotuzumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( elotuzumab group ) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone ( control group ) . Coprimary end points were progression - free survival and the overall response rate . Final results for the coprimary end points are reported on the basis of a planned interim analysis of progression - free survival . RESULTS Overall , 321 patients were assigned to the elotuzumab group and 325 to the control group . After a median follow - up of 24.5 months , the rate of progression - free survival at 1 year in the elotuzumab group was 68 % , as compared with 57 % in the control group ; at 2 years , the rates were 41 % and 27 % , respectively . Median progression - free survival in the elotuzumab group was 19.4 months , versus 14.9 months in the control group ( hazard ratio for progression or death in the elotuzumab group , 0.70 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.57 to 0.85 ; P<0.001 ) . The overall response rate in the elotuzumab group was 79 % , versus 66 % in the control group ( P<0.001 ) . Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the two groups were lymphocytopenia , neutropenia , fatigue , and pneumonia . Infusion reactions occurred in 33 patients ( 10 % ) in the elotuzumab group and were grade 1 or 2 in 29 patients . CONCLUSIONS Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who received a combination of elotuzumab , lenalidomide , and dexamethasone had a significant relative reduction of 30 % in the risk of disease progression or death .",

In myeloma cells , SLAMF7 signaling is compromised owing in part to the lack of EAT-2 expression ; therefore , elotuzumab does not induce the proliferation of myeloma cells . 8,9 In a single - group , phase 2 trial of elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( Study 1703 ) , this immunostimulatory activity translated into an improvement in progression - free survival in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma . 10 The objective of this randomized , phase 3 trial , called ELOQUENT-2 , was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone , as compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone , in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma .

The clinical efficacy that was noted in this trial supports the dual mechanism of action reported for elotuzumab . 7 In conclusion , the use of elotuzumab , an immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody targeting a cell - surface receptor with both direct activation of natural killer cells and the capacity to trigger antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity of myeloma cells , was associated with improved progression - free survival in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone , as compared with control patients receiving lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone .",

Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor with efficacy in relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma that inhibits tumor angiogenesis , a process that has been implicated in multiple myeloma pathogenesis . METHODS . In AMBER(''A Randomized , Blinded , Placebo - Controlled , Multicenter , Phase II Study of Bevacizumab in Combination With Bortezomib in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma ' ' ) , patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma were randomized to receive bortezomib ( 1.3 mg / m 2 on days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 of each 21-day cycle ) and either placebo or bevacizumab ( 15 mg / kg on day 1 of each cycle ) for up to 8 cycles . At completion , patients in the bortezomib - plus - bevacizumab arm could continue bevacizumab until they developed progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity . The primary endpoint was progression - free survival ( PFS ) . RESULTS . The stratified hazard ratio of PFS for the bevacizumab - containing arm ( n \u00bc 49 ) relative to the bortezomib monotherapy arm ( n \u00bc 53 ) was 0.743 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.43 - 1.28 ; P \u00bc .2804 ) ; the median PFS was 6.2 months ( 95 % CI , 4.4 - 8.5 months ) and 5.1 months ( 95 % CI , 4.2 - 7.2 months ) , respectively ; the overall response rates were 51 % and 43.4 % ( P \u00bc .4029 ) , respectively ; and the median response duration was 6.9 months ( 95 % CI , 4.73 - 11.83 months ) and 6.0 months ( 95 % CI , 4.86 - 8.31 months ) , respectively . Frequent adverse events occurred at similar rates across treatment arms , but hypertension , fatigue , and neuralgia occurred more frequently in the bevacizumab - containing arm . CONCLUSIONS . The addition of bevacizumab to bortezomib in unselected patients with pretreated multiple myeloma did not result in significant improvements in efficacy outcomes . The combination was well tolerated , and no new safety concerns for either agent were identified .",

Although it was generally well tolerated , bevacizumab , like other anti - VEGF agents , has been associated with specific AEs , including hypertension , which may be intensified or exacerbated by concomitant administration of chemotherapeutic agents . 20 The reason for the lack of significant benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to bortezomib therapy probably is multifactorial . It is believed that angiogenesis plays a role in promoting tumor growth , and inhibiting the activity of VEGF with bevacizumab has demonstrated clinical benefit in some malignancies ( eg , nonsmall cell lung cancer ) . Suppressing angiogenesis alone may be insufficient , however , because additional mechanisms and pathways are involved in tumor growth . 5 Consistent with this possibility , studies of the single - agent tyrosine kinase inhibitors SU5416 ( semaxanib ) , 21 ZD6474 ( zactima ) , 22 and GW786034 ( pazopanib ) 23 in patients with relapsed or refractory MM have failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefit for these VEGF receptor - targeted agents . Furthermore , angiogenesis inhibition , which reportedly is effected in part through a reduction in tumor cell VEGF secretion , 24 is 1 of the multiple anticancer mechanisms proposed for the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib . 25 Conceivably , further inhibition of this pathway may not add further clinical benefit . It is noteworthy that approximately 20 % of patients enrolled in this study had received bortezomib previously . Possibly this patient population required more extensive proteasome inhibition and/or the addition of dexamethasone to produce a greater tumor response . Another phase 2 study of bevacizumab for relapsed or refractory MM in which it was combined with dexamethasone and lenalidomide has reported a 70 % response rate with the combination , a nonsignificant improvement relative to the 61 % response rate previously reported in patients who received lenalidomide and high - dose dexamethasone . 18 More recently , another trial ( N \u00bc 12 ) in which patients with relapsed or refractory MM who had received prior thalidomide treatment received bevacizumab monotherapy ( n \u00bc 3 ) and those who had not received prior thalidomide treatment were randomized to either bevacizumab monotherapy ( n \u00bc 3 ) or bevacizumab with thalidomide ( n \u00bc 6 ) reported a similar median time to treatment failure for patients who received bevacizumab monotherapy and for those who received the combination therapy . Those authors concluded that future trials of anti - VEGF therapy in MM should focus on patients whose myeloma cells are enriched for VEGF expression . 26 Thus , the results from AMBER may reflect the unselected population of patients with relapsed or refractory MM .",

As the introduction of novel agents into clinical practice , median survival in MM has improved by 50 % . Pomalidomide ( CC4047 ) is a new IMiD with high in vitro potency . Phase I trials established pomalidomide as well tolerated in doses ranging from 1 to 5 mg / day . 1,2 IMiDs are hypothesized to act through multiple mechanisms . Although interest was initially focused on their anti - angiogenic effects , 3 current hypotheses suggest their antineoplastic effects are mediated by blocking signaling through nuclear factorkappa B ( NFkB ) 4 and induction of apoptosis through the caspase-8 / death receptor pathway . 5 In addition , IMiDs have potent immunomodulatory properties including downregulation of inflammatory cytokines , [ 6][7][8 ] augmentation of anti - myeloma natural killer cell activity 9,10 and stimulation of cytotoxic T - cells . 11,12 We previously reported our results using pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone ( Pom / dex ) for patients with relapsed MM . We found overall response rate ( partial response ( PR ) or better ) of 63 , and 82 % of patients had at least a 25 % drop in their measurable parameter by 12 weeks . Importantly , we observed responses in some patients who were refractory to lenalidomide , suggesting non - cross resistance between pomalidomide and the other IMiDs .

However , none of the new agents are curative and a patient with MM can expect to receive most or all of the active agents during his or her lifetime . Almost invariably patients eventually develop disease refractory to thalidomide , lenalidomide , bortezomib and alkylating agents posing a major challenge to physicians . In this setting , the remarkable activity of Pom / dex seen in this trial in a cohort of patients refractory to lenalidomide is significant . Moreover , the durability of response ( median , 9 months ) is clinically meaningful in this group with limited alternative treatment options . These results suggest that pomalidomide is either more potent than lenalidomide , or has significant non cross - resistance making the drug a potentially valuable addition to the limited number of active agents available for the treatment of relapsed refractory myeloma . In addition to being lenalidomide - refractory , the patients enrolled in this trial were heavily pre - treated with 70 % having had three or more previous regimens . Our study results are supported by preliminary results reported by Richardson and colleagues 16 in the MM-002 trial . Patients in MM-002 trial were heavily pre - treated with a median of seven previous therapies ; all had received previous lenalidomide and bortezomib . Minor response or better was seen in 52 % , results similar to what we observed in our study . In all studies so far , the main toxicity is hematologic , and overall the regimen is well tolerated with a low incidence of non - hematologic side effects",

A phase I trial including 24 patients used single agent pomalidomide and found 54 % of patients experienced a PR or better including four patients ( 17 % ) with CR . 1 However , the trials are not directly comparable . The patients treated by Schey and colleagues were less heavily pre - treated , and were enrolled before lenalidomide and bortezomib were available . An ongoing randomized phase II trial comparing pomalidomide alone versus pomalidomide plus dexamethasone will provide an answer to this question . The optimal dose of pomalidomide is also unclear . The Phase I portion of the MM-002 trial concluded the maximum tolerated dose is 4 mg daily administered on days 1 - 21 of a 28-day schedule . In our studies we have employed continuous daily dosing . In the present study , we allowed patients to escalate from 2 to 4 mg daily if there was a suboptimal response . Among the eight who escalated , one patient saw improvement ( stable disease to confirmed partial response ) . It is not clear whether response rates would be better with a starting dose of 4 mg daily , rather than waiting to escalate to the 4 mg dose once the cells were already resistant . We are now accruing patients to followup studies in which patients with relapsed / refractory myeloma are treated with a starting dose of 4 mg per day administered continuously .",

Methods : Eligibility criteria and study design were per the global study , except high - risk cytogenetic and patient - reported outcome endpoints were not assessed . The primary endpoint was PFS , assessed by the same IRC . Pts were analyzed separately from the global study . Sample size was not based on a formal statistical hypothesis . Results : 115 pts were randomized ( 57 IRd , 58 placebo - Rd ) . Compared to the global study , pts had more advanced disease ( 63 % ISS stage II / III vs 46 % in the global study ) , were more heavily pretreated ( 60 % vs 41 % had 2 or 3 prior therapies ) , and more frequently had refractory MM ( 43 % vs 11 % ) . At data cut - off ( 12 July 2015 ; median follow - up 8.0 vs 7.8 mos ) , PFS was significantly improved with IRd vs placebo - Rd : median 6.7 vs 4.0 mos ; HR 0.598 ; p = 0.035 .

Patients and Methods Six hundred forty - six patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg / m 2 on days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 of an every 21-days cycle , or the same bortezomib regimen with PLD 30 mg / m 2 on day 4 . Results Median time to progression was increased from 6.5 months for bortezomib to 9.3 months with the PLD \u03e9 bortezomib combination ( P \u03ed .000004 ; hazard ratio , 1.82 [ monotherapy v combination therapy ] ; 95 % CI , 1.41 to 2.35 ) . The 15-month survival rate for PLD \u03e9 bortezomib was 76 % compared with 65 % for bortezomib alone ( P \u03ed .03 ) . The complete plus partial response rate was 41 % for bortezomib and 44 % for PLD \u03e9 bortezomib , a difference that was not statistically significant . Median duration of response was increased from 7.0 to 10.2 months ( P \u03ed .0008 ) with PLD \u03e9 bortezomib . Grade 3/4 adverse events were more frequent in the combination group ( 80 % v 64 % ) , with safety profiles consistent with the known toxicities of the two agents . An increased incidence in the combination group was seen of grade 3/4 neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , asthenia , fatigue , diarrhea , and hand - foot syndrome . Conclusion PLD with bortezomib is superior to bortezomib monotherapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma . The combination therapy is associated with a higher incidence of grade 3/4 myelosuppression , constitutional symptoms , and GI and dermatologic toxicities .",

Several mechanisms by which malignant cells avoid the impact of chemotherapeutics are suppressed by proteasome inhibitors , including bcl-2 , nuclear factor kappa B , and P - glycoprotein ( reviewed in Voorhees et al 7 and Rajkumar et al 8 ) . In preclinical studies , bortezomib enhanced the activity of a number of antimyeloma agents , including doxorubicin , [ 9][10][11 ] and bortezomib suppressed repair pathways 12 that could sensitize cells to DNA damaging agents such as anthracyclines . Proteasome inhibitors themselves are pleiotropic , and activate prosurvival mechanisms that limit their effectiveness , including the heat shock response pathways . 13 Interestingly , doxorubicin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) suppressed bortezomib - mediated induction of some heat shock / stress response proteins , possibly explaining the synergy between these agents . 11,14 On the basis of this preclinical rationale , PLD \u03e9 bortezomib was evaluated in a phase I trial . 15 A schedule of bortezomib 1.3 mg / m 2 on days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 every 21 days , with PLD 30 mg / m 2 on day 4 , was safe and tolerable , and anti - MM activity was seen . A complete response ( CR ) rate of 36 % , and an overall response rate of 73 % was observed in a small cohort of myeloma patients , and longer - term follow - up demonstrated a 9.3-month TTP and a median OS of more than 3 years . 16 To test the possibility that PLD \u03e9 bortezomib prolongs TTP compared with bortezomib alone in patients with relapsed / refractory MM , a randomized controlled study was undertaken . The findings of a planned interim analysis ( IA ) , reported herein , support the hypothesis that this combination regimen is superior to singleagent bortezomib .",

All secondary end points were tested at the two - sided nominal significance level of .05 . The IA was performed after 249 events on the basis of a data cutoff of April 28 , 2006 , at which the median follow - up from random assignment was 7.2 months . The IA showed that patients undergoing treatment with PLD \u03e9 bortezomib had a significant TTP prolongation , which crossed the prespecified IA boundary . As a result , the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that these findings should be reported .",

It is possible that the response rate in the PLD \u03e9 bortezomib group in this trial was adversely affected by clinical factors , such as the greater frequency of drug discontinuations . Patients receiving the combination were more likely to suffer an AE ( 30 % ) leading to discontinuation , compared with bortezomib alone ( 24 % ) . These discontinuation rates were higher than in phase I. Also , the median number of PLD \u03e9 bortezomib cycles delivered in phase I was higher 16 than in this study . Thus , the ability to deliver more cycles of therapy , and of the complete regimen , may have led to the higher response rate in phase I , although it is of note that the TTP was identical between the two studies . Although PLD \u03e9 bortezomib increased only the overall response rate slightly over bortezomib alone , this translated into a dramatic TTP improvement . One explanation may be that the responses with PLD \u03e9 bortezomib were more durable , and is supported by the improved median DOR . This suggests that the benefits of PLD may be in enhancing the sensitivity of patients with bortezomib - responsive disease , possibly by improving the depth of a PR or CR . VGPR analysis confirmed the latter possibility ; the CR \u03e9 VGPR rate was 19 % for bortezomib , and 27 % for PLD \u03e9 bortezomib ( P \u03ed .0157 ) .

Clinical data have already suggested that addition of dexamethasone to bortezomib improves the response rate and quality in the up - front 22 and relapsed / refractory 23 settings . In the latter study , dexamethasone addition did not alter the type or number of AEs , possibly suggesting that bortezomib \u03e9 dexamethasone could be a better - tolerated regimen than that with PLD . However , larger randomized studies would be needed to test that hypothesis in the relapsed / refractory population , and to provide measures of response durability , which are currently lacking . Moreover , it is likely that an even more efficacious approach would be to add dexamethasone to PLD \u03e9 bortezomib . We did not pursue this approach here because our goal was to evaluate the benefits of adding PLD only , but preliminary studies have suggested this regimen is well - tolerated , and active . 24 Another class of agents with significant anti - MM activity are the immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide and lenalidomide , which are often prescribed with high - dose dexamethasone . 25,26 Lenalidomide \u03e9 dexamethasone in particular have shown a superior response rate , TTP , and OS to dexamethasone alone , but use of these regimens was complicated by steroid - mediated toxicities , and by thromboembolic events that led to recommendations for prophylactic anticoagulation . Among patients in the PLD \u03e9 bortezomib group , the rate of thromboembolic events was low in the absence of prophylactic anticoagulation . Thus , this regimen may be especially helpful in steroid - intolerant patients , or in those who have a high risk for thromboembolism and/or anticoagulation . Additional studies will be necessary to identify patient subgroups that benefit most from one of these options . In this regard , plasma cells were purified from patients on this study , and gene expression profiles are being evaluated to determine whether there is a profile predictive of response . Another option may be to use PLD \u03e9 bortezomib as a scaffold onto which other agents can be added to further enhance activity , and studies are ongoing to test the impact of adding dexamethasone , lenalidomide , melphalan , or thalidomide .",

There is less information on the efficacy and tolerability of weekly bortezomib regimens in the relapsed / refractory setting . Here , we report our experience of weekly intravenous bortezomib in clinical practice in relapsed / refractory patients . Methods : We analysed fifty - two patients who received weekly bortezomib for relapsed / refractory MM . Results : Thirty - one per cent of patients received bortezomib beyond first relapse . Almost all ( 94 % ) also received steroids and 48 % also received an alkylator . The median cumulative dose was 22.6 mg / m 2 , and median length of treatment was 164 d. Three patients reported grade 2 sensory neuropathy , and one reported grade 3 motor neuropathy . There were no grade 4 neurotoxicities . Eighty - three per cent achieved a PR or greater , and the median PFS for the whole group was 13 months . One - year PFS and OS were 53 % ( 95 % CI 39 - 66.6 % ) and 78 % ( 95 % CI 66.7 - 89.6 % ) , respectively .

In this study , dexamethasone was added for non - responding patients after cycle 4 . This study reported lower rates of ! grade 3 neurotoxicity in the subcutaneous bortezomib group , whilst disease responses were not influenced by route of administration . In this context , our weekly triplet drug regimens produced similar outcomes ( median PFS of 13 months ( 95 % CI 10.3 - 14.1 % ) vs. 10.4 months , 1-year OS of 78 % ( 95 % CI 66.7 - 89.6 % ) vs. 72.6 % ) when compared with the patients who received subcutaneous bortezomib . Importantly , we observed a similar toxicity profile to that of biweekly subcutaneous administration ( Table 4 ) .",

However , our results suggest that similar benefits can be achieved by a less dose - intense weekly intravenous schedule of bortezomib when used in combination with dexamethasone and an alkylator . Similar disease responses may be achieved using weekly subcutaneous bortezomib , with perhaps even better tolerability , an important consideration in the very elderly and frail patients . It remains to be established whether combination therapy employing subcutaneous biweekly bortezomib will achieve superior outcomes , such as to justify the additional expense . Our results here would suggest that , at least in the relapsed setting , the less intense weekly schedule is as effective , despite delivering a lower total treatment dose .",

                    "text": "Patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ) often respond to initial therapy ; however , the disease ultimately recurs and , over the course of time , becomes refractory to further treatment . Median survival is 5 years . There is thus an urgent need for more effective therapies in both first - line and relapsed settings . [ 1][2][3 ] Thalidomide , an immunomodulatory drug , was the first new drug to bring about an improvement in the therapy of MM after the introduction of melphalan and prednisone in the 1960s and of vincristine , doxorubicin , and dexamethasone in the 1980s . 4,5 In patients with relapsed or refractory MM receiving thalidomide , the complete response plus partial response ( CR \u03e9 PR ) rate was 29 % , and the 12-month event - free and overall survival ( OS ) rates were 34 % and 59 % , respectively . 6 Addition of dexamethasone to thalidomide enhanced response rates to within the range of 45 % to 57 % . 7 Bortezomib ( ( Velcade ; Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Cambridge , MA , and Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development , Raritan , NJ ) is a first - in - class proteasome inhibitor . Approval in the relapsed setting was based on the international phase III APEX trial of bortezomib versus high - dose dexamethasone in patients with MM who had received one to three prior therapies . 8,9 Bortezomib demonstrated superior time to progression ( TTP ) and a 6-month survival benefit over dexamethasone alone , despite more than 62 % of patients crossing over from the dexamethasone arm to receive bortezomib . The bortezomib response rate ( CR \u03e9 PR ) , based on European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation ( EBMT ) criteria , was 43 % , with 9 % CR , 7 % near - CR ( nCR ) , and 27 % PR . Furthermore , combining bortezomib and dexamethasone ( VD ) showed added benefit , even in patients refractory to prior dexamethasone treatment . 10 Preclinical studies have shown synergistic effects on adding an immunomodulatory drug ( eg , thalidomide or lenalidomide ) to bortezomib . 11 These two types of drug have different but overlapping mechanisms of anti - MM activity . In addition , both bortezomib and immunomodulatory drugs are able to enhance dexamethasone activity during all phases of MM . The results of small clinical trials have shown that even better response rates are achieved with a triple - drug combination that includes bortezomib , dexamethasone , and an immunomodulatory drug or an alkylator ( eg , cyclosphosphamide ) than with a two - drug combination ( thalidomide - dexamethasone or bortezomib - dexamethasone ) . [ 12][13][14 ] Available studies so far have not specifically addressed the subpopulation of patients with MM progressing or relapsing after autologous stem - cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . We report the results of a multicenter phase III prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of the triple combination of bortezomib - thalidomide - dexamethasone ( VTD ) versus the standard two - drug combination of thalidomide - dexamethasone ( TD ) in these patients . The primary end point was TTP .",

                    "text": "To reduce peripheral neuropathy , it may be prudent to adjust the bortezomib dose or schedule . There are several ways of doing this without having an impact on efficacy . The first is by reducing both bortezomib and thalidomide starting dose : The IFM ( Intergroupe Francophone du My\u00e9lome ) 2007 - 02 study compared a reduced dose of bortezomib ( 1 v 1.3 mg / m 2 per injection ) in a low - dose VTD versus high - dose VD protocol , in which thalidomide ( 100 mg per day ) was given as induction treatment before ASCT . Four cycles of VTD were more effective than four cycles of VD , since the CR \u03e9 VGPR rate was higher both before and after ASCT . The incidence of polyneuropathy was markedly reduced in the VTD arm despite the addition of thalidomide . 23 The second method - switching from twice - a - week to once - a - week bortezomib - has been shown to markedly reduce the incidence of grades 3 and 4 peripheral neuropathy ( from 28 % to 8 % ; P \u03fd .001 ) and associated discontinuations ( from 15 % to 5 % ; P \u03fd .001 ) , without having a large impact on CR rate ( decrease from 35 % to 30 % ; P \u03ed .27 ) or without greatly affecting long - term outcomes . 24 Third , subcutaneous bortezomib is as effective as intravenous bortezomib and is less neurotoxic . 25,26 In the future , genetic predisposition analysis may help identify patients at greater risk of neuropathy and in whom dose adjustment would be advisable . 27 An alternative to bortezomib dose reduction is substituting lenalidomide for thalidomide in the triple combination ( ie , lenalidomidebortezomib - dexamethasone ) in patients with newly diagnosed MM . The reported incidence of grade 3 neurologic toxic effects after a median of eight cycles of therapy was only 6 % . 28 In the relapsed setting , grade 3 to 4 toxicities included 30 % neutropenia , 22 % thrombocytopenia , and 3 % neuropathy . Median TTP was 9.5 months , median PFS was 9.5 months , and the 2-year OS rate was 55 % . 29 To enhance DOR in our study , the first 6 months of bortezomib treatment were followed by a relatively short ( 6-month ) maintenance phase at a lower dose . The maintenance phase may have contributed to the high TTP and prolonged DOR . In three major trials , thalidomide maintenance post - ASCT enhanced response rates and extended event - free survival , PFS , and OS . [ 30][31][32 ] Two prospective randomized studies have shown that post - ASCT maintenance therapy with lenalidomide prolongs PFS and TTP compared with placebo . No improvement has yet been observed in OS . 33,34 Two trials of bortezomib - thalidomide have confirmed the feasibility and efficacy of maintenance therapy . 35,36 In conclusion , our study has demonstrated the superiority of the triple - combination VTD over the dual TD combination in the treatment of patients with MM progressing or relapsing post - ASCT . However , neurotoxicity is an issue of concern and requires appropriate dose reduction . In light of our experience , we suggest a starting dose of 100 mg per day thalidomide for the VTD combination . This combination may be considered a new standard of care for this subpopulation of patients .",

Methods : Thalidomide - and bortezomib - na\u00efve patients with melphalan refractory myeloma were randomly assigned to low - dose thalidomide + dexamethasone ( Thal - Dex ) or bortezomib + dexamethasone ( Bort - Dex ) . At progression on either therapy , the patients were offered crossover to the alternative drug combination . An estimated 300 patients would be needed for the trial to detect a 50 % difference in median PFS between the treatment arms . Results : After inclusion of 131 patients , the trial was prematurely closed because of low accrual . Sixty - seven patients were randomized to Thal - Dex and 64 to Bort - Dex . Progression - free survival was similar ( median , 9.0 months for Thal - Dex and 7.2 for Bort - Dex ) . Response rate was similar ( 55 % for Thal - Dex and 63 % for Bort - Dex ) , but time to response was shorter ( P < 0.05 ) and the VGPR rate higher ( P < 0.01 ) for Bort - Dex . Time - to - other treatment after crossover was similar ( median , 13.2 months for Thal - Dex and 11.2 months for Bort - Dex ) , as was overall survival ( 22.8 months for Thal - Dex and 19.0 for Bort - Dex ) . Venous thromboembolism was seen in seven patients and cerebrovascular events in four patients in the Thal - Dex group . Severe neuropathy , reactivation of herpes virus infections , and mental depression were more frequently observed in the Bort - Dex group . In the quality - of - life analysis , no difference was noted for physical function , pain , and global quality of life . Fatigue and sleep disturbances were significantly more prevalent in the Bort - Dex group . Conclusions : Thalidomide ( 50 - 100 mg daily ) in combination with dexamethasone seems to have an efficacy comparable with that of bortezomib and dexamethasone in melphalan refractory myeloma . However , the statistical strength of the results in this study is limited by the low number of included patients .",

In 2007 , when this study was initiated , there was still a consensus in most centers on the use of high - dose melphalan with autologous stem cell support for initial therapy in younger patients and melphalan - prednisone in elderly patients ( 1 ) . For relapsed and refractory disease , however , few randomized clinical trials had been performed and no consensus on best choice of therapy was present . Thalidomide was frequently used since the initial report on favorable results in 1999 ( 2 ) . A systematic review of published phase II studies on thalidomide monotherapy reported a 29 % response rate ( 3 ) . The addition of dexamethasone to thalidomide was reported to increase the response rate to 46 % with a median event - free survival of 8 months ( 4 ) . However , no randomized trials were carried out , and thalidomide was not approved by the European authorities . Bortezomib was introduced in 2006 and approved after the publications of two phase II studies ( 5,6 ) and one phase III study comparing bortezomib with high - dose dexamethasone ( 7,8 ) . Briefly , these studies reported a response rate of 30 - 43 % for bortezomib monotherapy , increasing 10 - 15 % after the addition of dexamethasone , and a median time to progression of 7 months . The phase III trial ( 7 ) showed a superiority of bortezomib over dexamethasone . In the setting of this study , no randomized studies have been published comparing thalidomide with bortezomib , nor any studies comparing any of these drugs with other chemotherapy .",

Recently , reports on single weekly bortezomib dosing and subcutaneous administration have shown a reduced rate of neurotoxicity without loss of efficacy ( 12,13 ) . Therefore , it can not be excluded that the patients in the Bort - Dex group had done better with once weekly bortezomib instead of twice weekly that was the standard dose at the time of the study . The spectrum of toxicity was mainly as expected . The limited number of patients in the study makes it difficult to compare the treatment arms for toxicity . Nevertheless , some observations are worth noting . There was a high rate of neurotoxicity in the Bort - Dex group , which underlines the necessity of a high grade of observance and dose reductions even at minor signs of neurotoxicity . A high but similar rate of severe infections was found in both treatment groups . Dexamethasone , which may have contributed to this event , was given in an equivalent total dose in the two treatment groups . The increased risk of herpes virus reactivations during bortezomib treatment has been noted in other studies ( 14 ) and underscores the recommendations of acyclovir prophylaxis ( 15 ) . As concerns psychiatric toxicity , we observed several depressive reactions in the Bort - Dex group . However , the significance of this finding is not clear because of the low number of patients .

Patients with relapsed or refractory MM who received treatment with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in the presence of del(13 ) and t(4;14 ) chromosomal abnormalities had lower overall response rates ( ORRs ) and shorter median progression - free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) compared with those who did not have these abnormalities . The results also showed that prior treatment with bortezomib was associated with shorter median PFS and OS . Progression during thalidomide therapy was the only significant independent predictor for OS and that the presence of del(13 ) and hemoglobin levels o10 g per 100 ml were prognostic factors for ORR and PFS , but not OS , in these heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory MM patients treated with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone .",

In this study of patients with relapsed or refractory MM with del(13 ) , t ( 4;14 ) , and del(17p ) cytogenetic abnormalities achieved an ORR of 59 % , similar to that reported ( 60.6 % ) for the overall cohort of patients in the pivotal phase III registration studies . 3,4 Patients with del(13 ) and t(4;14 ) chromosomal abnormalities had lower ORRs and shorter median PFS and OS compared with those who did not have these abnormalities . These results partly contrast the MM-016 study by Reece et al . , 10 which reported that relapsed and refractory MM patients treated with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone overcame poor prognosis conferred by the chromosomal abnormalities of del(13 ) , t(4;14 ) , but not del(17p ) , as evidenced by the findings that the advantage in TTP and OS conferred by the addition of lenalidomide to dexamethasone were independent of del(13 ) or t ( 4;14 ) abnormalities . However , the study also reported that both del(13q ) and t ( 4;14 ) were associated with shorter TTP in univariate analyses , and that the ORRs in patients with del(13q ) , t ( 4;14 ) , and del(17p13 ) ( 76.4 , 78.6 and 58.3 % , respectively ) were lower than reported for the overall study population ( 83.1 % ) . The partial contrast between these findings could be a result of differences in patient characteristics between the two studies . Patients in our study were older ( median age of 65 years vs 61 years ) , had a higher median number of prior therapies ( 3 vs 2 ) , and a higher proportion of patients with earlier thalidomide ( 86 % vs 54 % ) or bortezomib ( 81 % vs 46 % ) therapy . However , our results confirm those observed in newly diagnosed patients , although the definition of high - risk patients was slightly different . 11 Another finding in this study is the prognostic value of isolated del ( 13 ) . In studies analyzing patients at diagnosis , isolated del(13 ) ( that is not associated with t ( 4;14 ) or del(17p ) ) was not associated with a particular outcome . In other words , all the prognostic value of del(13 ) was related to the prognostic impact of related chromosomal abnormalities . In this study , del ( 13 ) was associated with a lower ORR and a shorter PFS . This may suggest that del(13 ) displays a different prognostic value at diagnosis and in later phases of the disease .",

Wang et al . 14 reported that efficacy of lenalidomide and dexamethasone was superior to dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed or refractory MM treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone regardless of prior thalidomide exposure . The efficacy results were more favorable for patients without than with prior thalidomide treatment ; however , this was also observed for patients treated with dexamethasone alone and probably reflects the fact that patients with prior thalidomide exposure were more heavily pretreated ( median 3 vs 2 prior therapies ) . In this study , we found that prior thalidomide made no difference in PFS or OS according to univariate and multivariate analyses , but that patients who progressed on thalidomide had shorter OS than patients who had not progressed on thalidomide . In addition , for patients who had not progressed on thalidomide , those without del(13 ) had better OS than patients with del(13 ) ; however , for patients who had progressed on thalidomide , the presence of del(13 ) did not have an adverse effect on OS . Patients who were resistant to thalidomide had an additional line of prior therapy ( median of 4 vs 3 prior lines ) and a higher incidence of t(4;14 ) ( 16 % vs 9 % ) than patients who were not resistant to thalidomide , which may account for poorer outcomes observed in these patients . However , the main explanation is probably a cross - resistance between the two related drugs . Finally , patients who had received prior bortezomib therapy had significantly shorter median PFS and OS compared with those with no earlier bortezomib treatment . Our data show that OS is only compromised in patients who progressed on thalidomide if they received prior bortezomib , which suggests that bortezomib may induce resistance to late salvage therapy . This could be related to the adaptive mechanisms , which allow cells to develop resistance to proteasome inhibitors and establish a hyperproliferative and apoptosis - resistant phenotype . 15,16 However , we have to stress that patients who did not receive bortezomib presented a lower median number of lines of treatment ( median \u00bc 2 ) , than those who receive prior bortezomib ( median \u00bc 4 ) .",

The combined complete and partial response rates were 38 percent for bortezomib and 18 percent for dexamethasone ( P<0.001 ) , and the complete response rates were 6 percent and less than 1 percent , respectively ( P<0.001 ) . Median times to progression in the bortezomib and dexamethasone groups were 6.22 months ( 189 days ) and 3.49 months ( 106 days ) , respectively ( hazard ratio , 0.55 ; P<0.001 ) .

The combination of the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone has shown efficacy in a phase 1 and 2 study in relapsed multiple myeloma . Methods We randomly assigned 792 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma to carfilzomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( carfilzomib group ) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone ( control group ) . The primary end point was progression - free survival . Results Progression - free survival was significantly improved with carfilzomib ( median , 26.3 months , vs. 17.6 months in the control group ; hazard ratio for progression or death , 0.69 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.57 to 0.83 ; P = 0.0001 ) . The median overall survival was not reached in either group at the interim analysis . The Kaplan - Meier 24-month overall survival rates were 73.3 % and 65.0 % in the carfilzomib and control groups , respectively ( hazard ratio for death , 0.79 ; 95 % CI , 0.63 to 0.99 ; P = 0.04 ) . The rates of overall response ( partial response or better ) were 87.1 % and 66.7 % in the carfilzomib and control groups , respectively ( P<0.001 ; 31.8 % and 9.3 % of patients in the respective groups had a complete response or better ; 14.1 % and 4.3 % had a stringent complete response ) . Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported in 83.7 % and 80.7 % of patients in the carfilzomib and control groups , respectively ; 15.3 % and 17.7 % of patients discontinued treatment owing to adverse events . Patients in the carfilzomib group reported superior health - related quality of life . Conclusions In patients with relapsed multiple myeloma , the addition of carfilzomib to lenalidomide and dexamethasone resulted in significantly improved progression - free survival at the interim analysis and had a favorable risk - benefit profile .",

In further support of this three - drug regimen , preliminary results have shown that carfilzomib , lenalidomide , and dexamethasone can also be highly effective in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma . 23,24 The benefit with respect to progression - free survival in the carfilzomib group was observed across all prespecified subgroups , including patients previously exposed to bortezomib or len alid omide and those with a high cytogenetic risk . Patients in the carfilzomib group also had a higher overall response rate than those in the control group , with a longer median duration of response . The finding that the rate of complete response or better in the carfilzomib group was more than 3 times the rate in the control group is particularly encouraging , because studies have shown an association between more robust responses and improved survival in patients with multiple myeloma . 25 Overall survival favored the carfilzomib group , with a hazard ratio for death of 0.79 ; however , the result did not cross the stopping boundary at the interim analysis of overall survival .",

Previous studies of len alidomide plus high - dose dexamethasone have shown a median progression - free survival of 9 to 11 months in similar patient populations . 4,28 This improvement could be due to the reduced toxicity of lower doses of dexamethasone . Studies examining continuous versus fixed - duration lenalidomide therapy have shown that continuous treatment leads to improved progression - free survival . 6,[29][30][31][32 ] In our study , carfilzomib treatment was discontinued according to the study protocol after 18 cycles , because data on the long - term safety of carfilzomib were not yet available when the study was initiated . Results in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma show that continuous treatment with carfilzomib , lenalidomide , and dexamethasone can lead to more robust responses , 23,24,33 but additional studies are needed to test this hypothesis . Other ongoing studies are exploring different carfilzomib doses and schedules as a means of improving efficacy and convenience for patients . 23,24,34 In conclusion , carfilzomib combined with lena lidomide and dexamethasone led to a significant improvement in progression - free survival , as compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone , in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma .
