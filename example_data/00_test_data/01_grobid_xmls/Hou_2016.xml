<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This continuation study assessed the efficacy and safety of IRd vs placebo-Rd in pts with RRMM in China as a separate regional expansion of the global study. Methods: Eligibility criteria and study design were per the global study, except high-risk cytogenetic and patient-reported outcome endpoints were not assessed. The primary endpoint was PFS, assessed by the same IRC. Pts were analyzed separately from the global study. Sample size was not based on a formal statistical hypothesis. Results: 115 pts were randomized (57 IRd, 58 placebo-Rd). Compared to the global study, pts had more advanced disease (63% ISS stage II/III vs 46% in the global study), were more heavily pretreated (60% vs 41% had 2 or 3 prior therapies), and more frequently had refractory MM (43% vs 11%). At data cut-off (12 July 2015; median follow-up 8.0 vs 7.8 mos), PFS was significantly improved with IRd vs placebo-Rd: median 6.7 vs 4.0 mos; HR 0.598; p = 0.035.
