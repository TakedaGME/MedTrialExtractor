<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) often respond to initial therapy; however, the disease ultimately recurs and, over the course of time, becomes refractory to further treatment. Median survival is 5 years. There is thus an urgent need for more effective therapies in both first-line and relapsed settings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref> Thalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug, was the first new drug to bring about an improvement in the therapy of MM after the introduction of melphalan and prednisone in the 1960s and of vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone in the 1980s. <ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5</ref> In patients with relapsed or refractory MM receiving thalidomide, the complete response plus partial response (CR ϩ PR) rate was 29%, and the 12-month event-free and overall survival (OS) rates were 34% and 59%, respectively. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Addition of dexamethasone to thalidomide enhanced response rates to within the range of 45% to 57%. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Bortezomib ((Velcade; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, and Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Development, Raritan, NJ) is a first-in-class proteasome inhibitor. Approval in the relapsed setting was based on the international phase III APEX trial of bortezomib versus high-dose dexamethasone in patients with MM who had received one to three prior therapies. <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9</ref> Bortezomib demonstrated superior time to progression (TTP) and a 6-month survival benefit over dexamethasone alone, despite more than 62% of patients crossing over from the dexamethasone arm to receive bortezomib. The bortezomib response rate (CR ϩ PR), based on European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria, was 43%, with 9% CR, 7% near-CR (nCR), and 27% PR. Furthermore, combining bortezomib and dexamethasone (VD) showed added benefit, even in patients refractory to prior dexamethasone treatment. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Preclinical studies have shown synergistic effects on adding an immunomodulatory drug (eg, thalidomide or lenalidomide) to bortezomib. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> These two types of drug have different but overlapping mechanisms of anti-MM activity. In addition, both bortezomib and immunomodulatory drugs are able to enhance dexamethasone activity during all phases of MM. The results of small clinical trials have shown that even better response rates are achieved with a triple-drug combination that includes bortezomib, dexamethasone, and an immunomodulatory drug or an alkylator (eg, cyclosphosphamide) than with a two-drug combination (thalidomide-dexamethasone or bortezomib-dexamethasone). <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> Available studies so far have not specifically addressed the subpopulation of patients with MM progressing or relapsing after autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). We report the results of a multicenter phase III prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of the triple combination of bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD) versus the standard two-drug combination of thalidomide-dexamethasone (TD) in these patients. The primary end point was TTP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PATIENTS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p>Patients with confirmed MM and measurable disease were eligible if they had progressed or relapsed after at least one ASCT and provided it was their first progression or relapse. Previous allogeneic transplantation was prohibited. A Karnofsky performance status above 50%, platelets at or higher than 40,000/L, absolute neutrophil count at or higher than 1,000/L, and creatinine clearance at or higher than 30 mL/min were required. Exclusion criteria included grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy. On retrospective analysis, 31 patients did not meet these criteria, that is, 15 patients had neuropathy above grade 1, six had impaired hematopoiesis, four had impaired kidney function, five patients were in second relapse, and one had nonsecretory MM. These deviations were evenly distributed in both arms and, since the deviations were considered minor, all patients originally included were analyzed. Women of childbearing age had to use a method of birth control and have a negative serum or urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test at screening and throughout the study. Men had to use contraception. Review boards at participating institutions and regulatory authorities approved the study, which was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Treatment</head><p>This international randomized, controlled, open-label study enrolled 269 patients from 60 centers and randomly assigned them to the triple combination VTD or to the dual combination TD (CONSORT diagram; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1)</ref>. Patients were stratified by number of previous ASCTs and by center at screening. All patients received thalidomide scheduled at 200 mg per day orally for 1 year and dexamethasone 40 mg per day orally for four days every 3 weeks for 1 year. Patients assigned to VTD received 1.3 mg/m 2 bortezomib as an intravenous bolus on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 followed by a 10-day rest period (day 12 to day 21) for eight cycles (6 months) and then on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 followed by a 20-day rest period (day 23 to day 42) for four cycles (6 months). Antithrombotic prophylaxis was mandatory in both arms. Enoxaparin (40 mg per day subcutaneously) was used for primary prophylaxis, and warfarin was used for secondary prophylaxis. Prophylaxis against herpes zoster infection was highly recommended in the VTD arm. Transfusion support as well as neutrophils and erythropoietic growth factors were allowed. Bisphosphonates were used according to established guidelines. Dose reduction strategies were recommended for significant toxicities.</p><p>Study treatment continued for 1 year. Treatment was withheld on withdrawal of the patient's consent, disease progression, or the occurrence of any grade 4 toxic effects. Patients who were still responding after 1 year of treatment could continue, provided that treatment was tolerated. A new transplantation, either autologous or allogeneic, could be performed only in patients who completed the planned 1-year treatment. The study did not allow crossover from the TD arm to the VTD arm.</p><p>The primary end point was TTP, defined as the interval from random assignment to disease progression, and was assessed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from random assignment to progression or death from any cause, OS, defined as the interval from random assignment to death from any cause, overall response rate (CR ϩ PR), and safety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessments</head><p>Progression and response were determined according to EBMT criteria 15 with reference to investigator-reported TTP or response reports. Two additional PR subcategories were defined. The nCR category was a PR subcategory meeting all CR criteria except for a positive immunofixation. The very good partial response (VGPR) subcategory (International Myeloma Working Group [IMWG] criteria) was a PR subcategory attained by patients who had had a 90% or greater reduction in their serum M-component since diagnosis. All patients, including those who discontinued treatment, were followed up for progression every 3 weeks for the first 6 months and every 6 weeks thereafter. Safety, assessed in all patients who received one or more drug doses until 30 days after the last dose, was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC, version 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>The study was designed to provide 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67 (VTD v TD) for TTP at a one-sided overall significance level of 0.025. Four interim analyses were planned to test for efficacy and futility using an alpha-spending function as for O'Brien-Fleming-type boundaries (for details, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1;</ref> implementation in EAST v 3.1.0, Cambridge, MA). The trial was stopped for superiority of VTD over TD after the second interim analysis performed after 134 events and a median follow-up of 24 months.</p><p>Median TTP was estimated from the cumulative incidence curve for progression (death without progression was a competing risk). The adjusted analysis was performed on the stratified Cox regression for the cause-specific hazard. Similar methods for competing risk end points were used to calculate time to achievement of response (with death and progression as competing events). The Kaplan-Meier probability estimator and Cox models were used to calculate PFS, OS, and duration of response (DOR). All analyses were performed using R v 2.10.0 software (http://www.r-project.org).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients and Treatment</head><p>From January 2006 to July 2010, 135 and 134 patients were randomly assigned to VTD and TD, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig 1)</ref>. Their baseline demographic data and other characteristics, including number of prior ASCTs, were well balanced ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1)</ref>. Median follow-up at the last update (March 2, 2011) was 30 months (range, 1 to 62 months) with 22 patients still being treated (11 in each arm).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy (ITT population)</head><p>Median TTP was longer in patients receiving VTD than TD (19.5 v 13.8 months). VTD reduced the risk of developing disease progression by 40% (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.80; P ϭ .001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 2A)</ref>. Median PFS was significantly longer for VTD than TD (18.3 months [95% CI, 15.5 to 20.6 months] v 13.6 months [95% CI, 9.9 to 16.1 months]; HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.81; P ϭ .001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 2B)</ref>. During the 1-year treatment period (cutoff, March 2, 2011), we recorded 14 deaths for VTD and 20 deaths for TD, 11 cases versus 17 cases of relapse/progression, three cases versus one case of infection, and zero cases versus two cases of secondary malignancy. The 24-month OS rates were not significantly different (71% [95% CI, 63% to 81%] for VTD v 65% [95% CI, 57% to 75%] for TD; P ϭ .093; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 2C)</ref>. Median TTP was longer in patients receiving VTD than TD regardless of the number of previous ASCTs (one or more; <ref type="figure">Fig 3)</ref>.</p><p>Complete response (CR ϩ nCR) rate was higher for VTD than for TD (45% v 25%; P ϭ .001), and the median DOR was longer (17.2 v 13.4 months; P ϭ .03). If the VGPRs were included with the complete responders (CR ϩ nCR), the response rate rose to 56% for VTD and 35% for TD (P Ͻ .001; <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Median time to first response (PR or better) was significantly shorter in patients treated with VTD than in those treated with TD (1.5 v 2.6 months; P Յ .001).</p><p>In a multivariate analysis of the overall study population, randomization to receive VTD was the key independent variable positively related to a better TTP (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.72; P Ͻ .001). The variables related to a worse TTP were high ␤2microglobulin (for the logarithm: HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.63 to 3.58; P Ͻ .001), high International Staging System score (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.02; P ϭ .02), and a chromosome 13 deletion (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.49 to 3.57; P Ͻ .001). A secondary analysis showed that early relapse, within 1 year from last ASCT, remained a bad prognosis parameter, but this risk factor had a lower impact in the VTD group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug Exposure, Patient Disposition, and Safety</head><p>The median number of treatment cycles received was 6.25 (6.25 of 8; 78%) in the VTD arm and 6.88 (6.88 of 8; 86%) in the TD arm during the first 6 months of treatment. It was 7.56 (7.56 of 12; 63%) for VTD and 9.93 (9.93 of 16; 62%) for TD at the end of the 1-year treatment period. The percentage of patients receiving planned doses was as follows: 46.6% bortezomib, 40.6% thalidomide, and 78.9% dexamethasone when randomly assigned to VTD therapy and 55.8% thalidomide and 76.7% dexamethasone when randomly assigned to TD. The percentage of patients in whom doses were reduced (Յ 1.0 mg/m 2 bortezomib, Յ 100 mg per day thalidomide) was as follows: in the VTD arm, 6% for bortezomib, 22% for thalidomide, and 28% for both bortezomib and thalidomide; in the TD arm, 30% for thalidomide. The highest toxicity occurred after cycle 4 in the VTD arm and after cycle 6 in the TD arm. Because of AEs, 38 patients (28%) discontinued VTD treatment and 12 patients (9%) discontinued TD before the end of the planned 1-year treatment period.  The incidence of AEs is given in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The incidence of grade 4 AEs was relatively low. Severe myelosuppression was uncommon, and grade 4 neutropenia, related febrile neutropenia, and sepsis were rare. The most clinically significant AE was cumu-lative, dose-related, peripheral sensory neuropathy <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>. Thrombocytopenia was transient and was not associated with serious bleeding complications. Thromboembolic events were rare: five cases versus 10 cases of deep vein thrombosis and five cases versus two cases of pulmonary embolism for VTD versus TD. Most AEs responded to standard management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This study has shown that patients with MM progressing or relapsing after ASCT have significantly better outcomes if they receive VTD rather than TD. Median TTP was significantly longer (19.5 v 13.8 Cumulative incidence curve for time to progression according to the number of previous autologous (auto) transplantations (one or more). TD, thalidomide-dexamethasone; VTD, bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone. months; P ϭ .001) as were PFS and DOR (P ϭ .001 and P ϭ .04, respectively). The hazard of disease progression was reduced by 40% when using the triple combination. The long TTP (19.5 months) in patients receiving VTD compares favorably with published findings on single or dual bortezomib therapy. The TTP for bortezomib was only 6 months in the APEX trial 9 and 9 months for the combination of bortezomib plus a liposomal anthracycline. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Our 19-month TTP is, in fact, even longer than the longest TTP recorded so far, namely for lenalidomide-dexamethasone (13 months in the MM-009 and MM-010 trials). <ref type="bibr">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">18</ref> However, trial comparisons must be viewed with caution because of differences in study populations, dose intensity, or use of maintenance therapy. Published studies often refer to patient mixes (relapsed and refractory patients with MM), with or without ASCT. All our patients had undergone at least one ASCT. None had refractory disease. These two things together could explain our better results.</p><p>A higher efficacy of the VTD combination was observed, even after adjusting for factors for high risk of disease progression (eg, advanced age, increased ␤2-microglobulin level, prior thalidomide or bortezomib treatment, and chromosome 13 deletion), thus demon-strating that bortezomib provides extra benefit in both good-and poor-prognosis patients.</p><p>We observed no significant difference in OS between VTD and TD over a median follow-up of 30 months. Two phase III trials of induction regimens before ASCT have also established superiority of VTD over TD (higher CR rate and lower progressive disease rate, longer TTP and PFS) but not in terms of OS. <ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">20</ref> Reasons for the lack of a difference in OS may be a follow-up that is too short, a sample size that is too small, and/or post progression therapy, including bortezomib. However, OS for VTD may yet prove to be greater than that for TD if the follow-up period is prolonged, even in the ITT analysis. An improved OS was observed after prolonged follow-up in the phase III trials of lenalidomide-dexamethasone (MM-009 and MM-010). <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Addition of bortezomib to TD more than doubled the CR ϩ nCR rate in our study. An almost three-fold increase in response has been reported in the first-line setting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">20</ref> A CR, or at least a VGPR, in the first-line setting is associated with improved outcomes. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Response rates may differ between the first-line and relapsed settings because of differences in tumor biology at diagnosis and relapse after ASCT.</p><p>The safety profile of VTD was consistent with the known toxicities of bortezomib and thalidomide. The overall incidence of grade 3 and 4 AEs was greater for VTD than for TD (71% v 57%). Severe myelosuppression was uncommon. Grade 4 neutropenia, related febrile neutropenia, and sepsis were rare. Thrombocytopenia was transient and not associated with serious bleeding complications. Appropriate prophylaxis resulted in few thromboembolic events and virtually abrogated the risk of reactivation of varicella-zoster virus infection associated with bortezomib-based therapies.</p><p>The most clinically significant AE was cumulative, dose-related peripheral sensory neuropathy (grade 3), which occurred in 29% of patients on VTD and 12% on TD. This was a higher incidence than expected. Above grade 2 neurotoxicity was twice as high in our study (31%) as that reported for thalidomide (6%) or bortezomib (13%). <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> Risk factors for peripheral neuropathy include prior occurrence, prior chemotherapy, and age. In the VTD and TD arms of our study, 10% and 6% of patients, respectively, had received thalidomide before inclusion, 20% and 21% had received bortezomib, and 15% and 19% had grade 1 or 2 neuropathy. The high starting doses and the duration of treatment were probably the main causes for higher neurotoxicity. In the patients still receiving VTD after 1 year, 70% were receiving a reduced dose of thalidomide and 54% a reduced dose of bortezomib.</p><p>To reduce peripheral neuropathy, it may be prudent to adjust the bortezomib dose or schedule. There are several ways of doing this without having an impact on efficacy. The first is by reducing both bortezomib and thalidomide starting dose: The IFM (Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome) 2007-02 study compared a reduced dose of bortezomib (1 v 1.3 mg/m 2 per injection) in a low-dose VTD versus high-dose VD protocol, in which thalidomide (100 mg per day) was given as induction treatment before ASCT. Four cycles of VTD were more effective than four cycles of VD, since the CR ϩ VGPR rate was higher both before and after ASCT. The incidence of polyneuropathy was markedly reduced in the VTD arm despite the addition of thalidomide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">23</ref> The second method-switching from twice-a-week to once-a-week bortezomib-has been shown to markedly reduce the incidence of grades 3 and 4 peripheral neuropathy (from 28% to 8%; P Ͻ .001) and associated discontinuations (from 15% to 5%; P Ͻ .001), without having a large impact on CR rate (decrease from 35% to 30%; P ϭ .27) or without greatly affecting long-term outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">24</ref> Third, subcutaneous bortezomib is as effective as intravenous bortezomib and is less neurotoxic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">26</ref> In the future, genetic predisposition analysis may help identify patients at greater risk of neuropathy and in whom dose adjustment would be advisable. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> An alternative to bortezomib dose reduction is substituting lenalidomide for thalidomide in the triple combination (ie, lenalidomidebortezomib-dexamethasone) in patients with newly diagnosed MM. The reported incidence of grade 3 neurologic toxic effects after a median of eight cycles of therapy was only 6%. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> In the relapsed setting, grade 3 to 4 toxicities included 30% neutropenia, 22% thrombocytopenia, and 3% neuropathy. Median TTP was 9.5 months, median PFS was 9.5 months, and the 2-year OS rate was 55%. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> To enhance DOR in our study, the first 6 months of bortezomib treatment were followed by a relatively short (6-month) maintenance phase at a lower dose. The maintenance phase may have contributed to the high TTP and prolonged DOR. In three major trials, thalidomide maintenance post-ASCT enhanced response rates and extended event-free survival, PFS, and OS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr">[32]</ref> Two prospective randomized studies have shown that post-ASCT maintenance therapy with lenalidomide prolongs PFS and TTP compared with placebo. No improvement has yet been observed in OS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">34</ref> Two trials of bortezomib-thalidomide have confirmed the feasibility and efficacy of maintenance therapy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">35,</ref><ref type="bibr">36</ref> In conclusion, our study has demonstrated the superiority of the triple-combination VTD over the dual TD combination in the treatment of patients with MM progressing or relapsing post-ASCT. However, neurotoxicity is an issue of concern and requires appropriate dose reduction. In light of our experience, we suggest a starting dose of 100 mg per day thalidomide for the VTD combination. This combination may be considered a new standard of care for this subpopulation of patients.</p></div>
