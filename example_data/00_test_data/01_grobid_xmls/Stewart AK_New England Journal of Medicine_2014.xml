				<p>Background Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is a reference treatment for relapsed multiple myeloma. The combination of the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone has shown efficacy in a phase 1 and 2 study in relapsed multiple myeloma. Methods We randomly assigned 792 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma to carfilzomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (carfilzomib group) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (control group). The primary end point was progression-free survival. Results Progression-free survival was significantly improved with carfilzomib (median, 26.3 months, vs. 17.6 months in the control group; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.83; P = 0.0001). The median overall survival was not reached in either group at the interim analysis. The Kaplan-Meier 24-month overall survival rates were 73.3% and 65.0% in the carfilzomib and control groups, respectively (hazard ratio for death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.99; P = 0.04). The rates of overall response (partial response or better) were 87.1% and 66.7% in the carfilzomib and control groups, respectively (P&lt;0.001; 31.8% and 9.3% of patients in the respective groups had a complete response or better; 14.1% and 4.3% had a stringent complete response). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported in 83.7% and 80.7% of patients in the carfilzomib and control groups, respectively; 15.3% and 17.7% of patients discontinued treatment owing to adverse events. Patients in the carfilzomib group reported superior health-related quality of life. Conclusions In patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, the addition of carfilzomib to lenalidomide and dexamethasone resulted in significantly improved progression-free survival at the interim analysis and had a favorable risk-benefit profile.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S</head><p>urvival rates have improved for patients with multiple myeloma, yet relapse remains common, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> indicating an ongoing need for new therapeutic approaches. The immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide in combination with high-dose dexamethasone is approved for use in relapsed multiple myeloma on the basis of phase 3 trials showing superiority to dexamethasone alone, with a median progression-free survival of 11.1 months and an overall response rate of 60%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> In previously untreated patients, lower weekly doses of dexamethasone proved less toxic and more effective than high-dose dexamethasone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Indeed, in a recent phase 3 study, lenalidomide with weekly dexamethasone, administered until disease progression, was associated with significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> The combination of lenalidomide and weekly dexamethasone is therefore considered a reference regimen for both newly diagnosed and relapsed multiple myeloma.</p><p>Carfilzomib is an epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor that binds selectively and irreversibly to the constitutive proteasome and immunoproteasome. In phase 1 studies, a maximum tolerated dose was not established for carfilzomib monotherapy. However, on the basis of the overall observed sideeffect profile, an initial dose of 20 mg per square meter of body-surface area with subsequent escalation to 27 mg per square meter was selected for further study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> This regimen of carfilzomib monotherapy was subsequently approved in the United States for use in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma on the basis of a phase 2 study that showed a 23.7% overall response rate in this population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> In a phase 1 and 2 study, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and weekly dexamethasone showed activity in patients with relapsed disease; adverse events were consistent with the known toxicity profiles of the three agents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> In the randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study described here, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of carfilzomib with lenalidomide and weekly dexamethasone as compared with lenalidomide and weekly dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p>Adults with relapsed multiple myeloma and measurable disease who had received one to three prior treatments were eligible. Patients previously treated with bortezomib were eligible provided that they did not have disease progression during treatment. Patients previously treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone were eligible so long as they did not discontinue therapy because of adverse effects, have disease progression during the first 3 months of treatment, or have progression at any time during treatment if lenalidomide plus dexamethasone was their most recent treatment. All patients had adequate hepatic, hematologic, and renal function (creatinine clearance, ≥50 ml per minute) at screening. Patients were excluded if they had grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy (or grade 2 with pain) within 14 days before randomization or New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure.</p><p>The study protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating institutions. All patients provided written informed consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p>Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive carfilzomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (carfilzomib group) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (control group) in 28-day cycles until withdrawal of consent, disease progression, or the occurrence of unacceptable toxic effects. Randomization was stratified according to the β 2 -microglobulin level (&lt;2.5 mg per liter vs. ≥2.5 mg per liter), previous therapy with bortezomib (no vs. yes), and previous therapy with lenalidomide (no vs. yes). Carfilzomib was administered as a 10-minute infusion on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 (starting dose, 20 mg per square meter on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1; target dose, 27 mg per square meter thereafter) during cycles 1 through 12 and on days 1, 2, 15, and 16 during cycles 13 through 18, after which carfilzomib was discontinued. Lenalidomide (25 mg) was given on days 1 through 21. Dexamethasone (40 mg) was administered on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Pretreatment and post-treatment intravenous hydration (250 to 500 ml) was required during cycle 1. Pretreatment hydration could be continued in subsequent cycles at the investigator's discretion. Patients in both groups received only lenalidomide and dexamethasone beyond cycle 18 until disease progression. Patients also received antiviral and antithrombotic prophylaxis.</p><p>The primary end point was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary end points included overall survival, the rate of overall response (partial response or better), duration of response, health-related quality of life, and safety. The rate of clinical benefit (minimal response or better) was an exploratory end point. The trial was designed by the first, second, next-to-last, and last authors and the sponsor, Onyx Pharmaceuticals. Data were collected and analyzed by the sponsor; all the authors had access to the data. The first author prepared an initial draft of the manuscript in collaboration with the sponsor and a medical writer paid by the sponsor. All authors contributed to subsequent drafts, made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication, and vouch for the accuracy and integrity of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessments</head><p>Treatment responses and disease progression were assessed centrally in a blinded manner by an independent review committee. Disease assessments were made with the use of the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> with minimal response defined according to European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> Disease assessments were performed on day 1 of each cycle. After treatment discontinuation, patients were followed for disease status (if they did not already have disease progression during treatment) and survival every 3 months for up to 1 year and for survival every 6 months thereafter.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p>A total of 392 patients in the carfilzomib group and 389 patients in the control group received at least one dose of study treatment. The median duration of treatment was 88.0 weeks (range, 1.0 to 185.0) in the carfilzomib group and 57.0 weeks (range, 1.0 to 201.0) in the control group; 69.9% and 77.9% of patients in the two groups, respectively, discontinued treatment, most commonly owing to disease progression (39.8% and 50.1%) or adverse events (15.3% and 17.7%) ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table S3</ref> in the Supplementary Appendix). In the carfilzomib group, adverse events resulted in a reduction of the carfilzomib dose in 11.0% of patients and a reduction of the lenalidomide dose in 43.4% of patients. In the control group, the lenalidomide dose was reduced in 39.1% of patients.</p><p>Adverse events of any grade that occurred more frequently in the carfilzomib group than in the control group by at least 5 percentage points included hypokalemia, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, pyrexia, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, nasopharyngitis, and muscle spasms ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3, and Table S4</ref> in the Supplementary Appendix); rates of discontinuation due to these events were less than 1% in both groups. There was no meaningful difference between groups in the incidence of peripheral neuropathy (17.1% in the carfilzomib group and 17.0% in the control group). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported in 83.7% of patients in the carfilzomib group and 80.7% of patients in the control group, and serious adverse events were reported in 59.7% and 53.7% of patients, respectively. Adverse events of specific interest (grade 3 or higher) included dyspnea (2.8% in the carfilzomib group and 1.8% in the control group), cardiac failure (grouped term; 3.8% and 1.8%), ischemic heart disease (grouped term; 3.3% and 2.1%), hypertension (4.3% and 1.8%), and acute renal failure (grouped term; 3.3% and 3.1%). Disease progression was assessed by the independent review committee. Panel A shows Kaplan-Meier estimates in the intention-to-treat population, with stratification according to the β 2 -microglobulin level (&lt;2.5 mg vs. ≥2.5 mg per liter), previous therapy with bor tezo mib (no vs. yes), and previous therapy with len a lid o mide (no vs. yes). The median progression-free survival was 8.7 months longer in the carfilzomib group than in the control group. Panel B shows hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for progression-free survival in prespecified subgroups according to baseline characteristics. Disease nonresponsive to bortezomib indicates that patients had a less-than-minimal response to any bortezomib-containing regimen, had disease progression during any bortezomib-containing regimen, or had disease progression within 60 days after the completion of any bortezomib-containing regimen. If patients had disease progression during any bor tezomib-containing regimen, they were eligible for study enrollment if the date of progression occurred after the discontinuation of bortezomib.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.

In further support of this three-drug regimen, preliminary results have shown that carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone can also be highly effective in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24</ref> The benefit with respect to progression-free survival in the carfilzomib group was observed across all prespecified subgroups, including patients previously exposed to bortezomib or len alid omide and those with a high cytogenetic risk. Patients in the carfilzomib group also had a higher overall response rate than those in the control group, with a longer median duration of response. The finding that the rate of complete response or better in the carfilzomib group was more than 3 times the rate in the control group is particularly encouraging, because studies have shown an association between more robust responses and improved survival in patients with multiple myeloma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25</ref> Overall survival favored the carfilzomib group, with a hazard ratio for death of 0.79; however, the result did not cross the stopping boundary at the interim analysis of overall survival.</p><p>A number of common adverse events were reported at a higher rate in the carfilzomib group than in the control group, including diarrhea, cough, fever, and hypertension. Although the duration of treatment was longer in the carfilzomib group than in the control group (median, 88 weeks vs. 57 weeks), serious adverse events, including cardiac events, were reported more frequently during the first 18 cycles of treatment than in later cycles <ref type="table">(Table S5</ref> in the Supplementary Appendix). A particular point of interest is that cardiac and renal events have been reported previously with carfilzomib monotherapy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">27</ref> Such events were also observed in this trial but at rates consistent with those in prior carfilzomib studies. The frequency of deaths that were considered to be related to adverse events was identical in the two groups despite the prolonged treatment exposure in the carfilzomib group. Patients in the carfilzomib group remained in remission longer and reported superior health-related quality of life (according to the score on the QLQ-C30 Global Health Status and Quality of Life scale) than those in the control group during 18 cycles of treatment.</p><p>The median progression-free survival in the control group was considerably longer than anticipated (17.6 months). Previous studies of len alidomide plus high-dose dexamethasone have shown a median progression-free survival of 9 to 11 months in similar patient populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">28</ref> This improvement could be due to the reduced toxicity of lower doses of dexamethasone.
