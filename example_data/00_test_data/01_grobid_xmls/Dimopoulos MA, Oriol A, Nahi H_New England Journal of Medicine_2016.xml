				<p>BACKGROUND Daratumumab showed promising efficacy alone and with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in a phase 1-2 study involving patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 569 patients with multiple myeloma who had received one or more previous lines of therapy to receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone either alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (daratumumab group). The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS At a median follow-up of 13.5 months in a protocol-specified interim analysis, 169 events of disease progression or death were observed (in 53 of 286 patients [18.5%] in the daratumumab group vs. 116 of 283 [41.0%] in the control group; hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.52; P&lt;0.001 by stratified log-rank test). The Kaplan-Meier rate of progression-free survival at 12 months was 83.2% (95% CI, 78.3 to 87.2) in the daratumumab group, as compared with 60.1% (95% CI, 54.0 to 65.7) in the control group. A significantly higher rate of overall response was observed in the daratumumab group than in the control group (92.9% vs. 76.4%, P&lt;0.001), as was a higher rate of complete response or better (43.1% vs. 19.2%, P&lt;0.001). In the daratumumab group, 22.4% of the patients had results below the threshold for minimal residual disease (1 tumor cell per 10 5 white cells), as compared with 4.6% of those in the control group (P&lt;0.001); results below the threshold for minimal residual disease were associated with improved outcomes. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 during treatment were neutropenia (in 51.9% of the patients in the daratumumab group vs. 37.0% of those in the control group), thrombocytopenia (in 12.7% vs. 13.5%), and anemia (in 12.4% vs. 19.6%). Daratumumab-associated infusion-related reactions occurred in 47.7% of the patients and were mostly of grade 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS The addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone significantly lengthened progression-free survival among patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Daratumumab was associated with infusion-related reactions and a higher rate of neutropenia than the control therapy.

A phase 3 trial of bortezomib and dexamethasone, with or without daratumumab, met its primary end point at the interim analysis and showed a significantly higher rate of progression-free survival, with a 61% lower risk of progression or death in the daratumumab group than in the control group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">18</ref> A phase 1-2 study of daratumumab, lena-lidomide, and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma showed that this combination provided therapeutic benefits, no dose-limiting toxic effects, and an 81% rate of overall response, including a 25% rate of stringent complete response (a definition of this term is provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">19</ref> At 18 months, the rate of progression-free survival was 72%, and the rate of overall survival was 90%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">19</ref> Here we report the results of a prespecified interim analysis of a phase 3 trial of daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial Design</head><p>In this randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 trial, we assigned patients who had relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and had received one or more lines of previous therapy to receive either daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (daratumumab group) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone (control group). Patients underwent randomization between June 16, 2014, and July 14, 2015, at 135 sites in 18 countries across North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. The trial was approved by the independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each site before the initiation of the trial.

Both groups received lenalidomide at a dose of 25 mg orally on days 1 to 21 of each cycle if the creatinine clearance was more than 60 ml per minute (or a dose of 10 mg daily if the creatinine clearance was 30 to 60 ml per minute) and dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg weekly. For the daratumumab group, the dose of dexamethasone was split: dexamethasone was administered at a dose of 20 mg before infusion as prophylaxis for infusion-related reactions and 20 mg was administered the next day. Patients in either group who were older than 75 years of age or whose body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was less than 18.5 received dexamethasone at a dose of 20 mg weekly at the discretion of their physician.

Data were collected by the investigators and associated research teams and were compiled and maintained by the sponsor. All the investigators had access to the data on request and were not restricted by confidentiality agreements. Professional medical writers prepared the manuscript and were funded by the sponsor. All the authors reviewed, revised, and approved the manuscript for submission. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol (available, with the statistical analysis plan, at NEJM.org).

The results for those outcomes are compatible with the results presented here or have not yet been met.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>The group-sequential design had one planned interim analysis to evaluate the primary end point. We calculated that approximately 560 patients with 295 events (disease progression or death) would be needed to provide the trial with 85% power to detect a 30% lower risk of disease progression or death (hazard ratio, 0.70), using a log-rank test, with an overall two-sided significance level of 0.05. This interim analysis was to be conducted when approximately 177 events were observed (60% of the total expected events). For the primary end point, the O'Brien-Fleming stopping boundary at the interim analysis was calculated with the use of the Lan-DeMets alphaspending function on the basis of the numbers of observed events at the clinical cutoff date. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">25</ref> If the primary end point was significant at the interim analysis, the major efficacy secondary end points of time to disease progression, rate of very good partial response, rate of results below the threshold for minimal residual disease, overall response rate, and overall survival, as ordered here, were sequentially tested, each with an overall two-sided alpha of 0.05. The population of patients whose response could be evaluated included patients who had measurable disease at baseline or the screening visit, had received at least one study treatment, and had undergone at least one disease assessment after the baseline visit; all the other efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population (patients who had undergone randomization). The safety population included all the patients who received at least one dose of trial treatment.</p><p>Progression-free survival was compared be-tween groups on the basis of a stratified logrank test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distributions and 12-month rates of progression-free survival. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated with the use of a Cox regression model, with treatment as the sole explanatory variable. Stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests were used to compare overall response rates, rates of very good partial response or better, and other binary end points. Duration of response was assessed by means of the Kaplan-Meier method.</p></div>

Adverse events that occurred at a frequency of 10% or more in the daratumumab group versus the control group were neutropenia, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, and cough, most of which resulted from longer exposure to treatment in the daratumumab group. Deep-vein thrombosis was reported in 1.8% of the patients in the daratumumab group and in 3.9% of those in the control group. In the daratumumab group, 51.9% of patients had neutropenia of grade 3 or 4, as compared with 37.0% of those in the control group; thrombocytopenia of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 12.7% and 13.5% of the patients, respectively.

Serious adverse events were reported in 48.8% of the patients in the daratumumab group and in 42.0% of those in the control group, among which pneumonia was the most common (in 8.1% of the patients in the daratumumab group and in 8.5% of those in the control group). Daratumumab interferes with laboratory-based bloodcompatibility tests, including indirect Coombs' test, because of binding to CD38 on red cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">26</ref> However, among patients who received blood transfusions, no hemolysis was observed.</p><p>The percentage of patients with adverse events leading to the discontinuation of treatment was similar in the two groups: 6.7% in the daratumumab group and 7.8% in the control group. The most common adverse events (in ≥1% of the patients in either group) that led to the discontinuation of treatment included pneumonia (in 1.1% of the patients in the daratumumab group and in 0.7% of those in the control group), pulmonary embolism (in 1.1% in the control group), and deterioration in general physical health (in 1.1% in the daratumumab group).

Low rates of secondary primary cancer were reported in the two groups (in 2.8% of the patients in the daratumumab group and in 3.6% of those in the control group); 10 of 18 patients (5 patients in each group) with secondary primary cancer had noninvasive, cutaneous secondary primary cancer such as squamous-cell carcinoma or basalcell carcinoma.</p><p>The incidence of daratumumab infusionrelated reactions of any grade was 47.7%, with 92% of the reactions occurring during the first infusion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results of this phase 3 trial show that the addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone significantly prolonged progression-free survival and was associated with a 63% lower risk of disease progression or death than lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone among patients with multiple myeloma who had received one or more lines of therapy previously. The treatment effect of daratumumab was consistent regardless of previous exposure to lenalidomide (a limitation being the relatively small number of patients with previous exposure to lenalidomide) and across all subgroups, including patients 65 years of age or older, those with disease that was refractory to proteasome inhibitors or the most recent line of therapy, those with International Staging System stage III disease, and those with previous exposure to a proteasome inhibitor or immunomodulatory drug. The treatment benefit that was associated with daratumumab was also similar in patients with one previous line of therapy and in those in a subgroup of patients with one, two, or three previous lines of therapy. Long-term follow-up is ongoing to assess differences in overall survival.</p><p>As in our trial (POLLUX), the addition of daratumumab to a standard-of-care regimen of bortezomib and dexamethasone in the CASTOR trial was associated with a significantly lower risk of disease progression or death. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">18</ref> As in the CASTOR trial, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">18</ref> the addition of daratumumab to the backbone regimen in our trial resulted in a significantly higher rate of overall response, deeper responses, and longer duration of response. After continued treatment, responses deepened, with a rate of complete response or better that was twice as high with daratumumab as with the backbone regimen alone.</p><p>Patients who have very good partial responses or better but have residual disease above recognized thresholds have poorer outcomes than do those who are free from detectable residual disease, and subsequent studies have recognized that minimal residual disease status may serve as a surrogate for estimating disease control and survival. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">6</ref> Although studies to date have focused on results below the threshold for minimal residual disease in patients with newly diagnosed disease (15% to 68% of patients across studies), <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">5</ref> the patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in our trial had a rate of below-threshold results that was more than four times as high in the daratumumab group as in the control group at the IMWG-recommended threshold of 1 tumor cell per 10 5 white cells for next-generation sequencing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">5</ref> Our findings were similar to findings in the context of first-line therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">6</ref> in that results below the threshold for minimal residual disease were associated with prolonged progression-free survival among patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This suggests that results below the threshold for minimal residual disease also should be a treatment goal in the context of relapsed or refractory disease. Cross-study comparisons should be interpreted with caution because of differences in study design and eligibility criteria. However, other studies that have aimed to improve treatment in the context of salvage therapy have been published. Two trials evaluated a proteasome inhibitor plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone, with a hazard ratio for disease progression or death of 0.69 (median progression-free survival, 26.3 vs. 17.6 months; overall response rate, 87% vs. 67%) with carfilzomib (in the ASPIRE [Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone versus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for the Treatment of Patients with Relapsed Multiple Myeloma] trial) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">27</ref> and a hazard ratio for disease progression or death of 0.74 (median progression-free survival, 20.6 vs. 14.7 months; overall response rate, 78% vs. 72%) with ixazomib (in the TOURMALINE-MM1 trial). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">28</ref> The ELOQUENT-2 trial of elotuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7) that lacks single-agent activity, in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone as compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone showed a hazard ratio for dis-ease progression or death of 0.70 (median progression-free survival, 19.4 vs. 14.9 months; overall response rate, 79% vs. 66%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">30</ref> Daratumumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was associated with clinically manageable adverse events that were consistent with the known toxic effects of lenalidomide and dexamethasone <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">31</ref> and of daratumumab. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">10</ref> Despite higher rates of neutropenia in the daratumumab group, the rate of infection of grade 3 or 4 was only slightly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group (28% vs. 23%). The rates of treatment discontinuation owing to adverse events were low and similar in the two groups. After the implementation of guidelines from other studies of daratumumab regarding the management of infusion-related reactions, infusion-related reactions were consistent with daratumumab monotherapy 9,10 and combination therapy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">32</ref> were mostly of grade 1 or 2, and usually occurred during the first infusion.</p><p>In conclusion, daratumumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was associated with a significant progression-free survival benefit and higher rates of overall response and results below the threshold for minimal residual disease than lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone among patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Although higher rates of neutropenia and infusion-related reactions (primarily during the first infusion) were observed with this combination than with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone, these events did not result in higher rates of treatment discontinuation or death.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Progression-free Survival.</figDesc></figure>
