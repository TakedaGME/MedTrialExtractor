cence
emissions
are
of
great
importance
to
the
scientiﬁc
community.1
These
molecular
ﬂuorophores
have
been
applied
to
a
wide
range
of
research
areas
,
including
chemistry
,
biology
,
and
material
science.2
In
2011
,
our
group
reported
N-2-aryl-
1,2,3-triazoles
(
NAT
)
as
novel
ﬂuorophores
with
strong
emission
in
the
high
-
energy
UV
/
blue
region.3
The
exper-
imental
results
(
X-ray
structures
)
and
computational
studies
conﬁrmed
the
coplanar
conformation
(
observed
in
N-2
isomers
,
Scheme
1A
)
as
the
key
factor
for
ﬂuorescence

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-2	sentence=0
We
have
previously
reported
that
N-2-aryl
triazole
1a
gave
very
strong
ﬂuorescence
emission
,
whereas
its
N-1
isomer
1b
gave
no
emission
at
all.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-2	sentence=1
Two
key
factors
appeared
to
control
the
ﬂuorescence
emission
in
these
NAT
dyes
:
N-2
substitution
and
coplanar
conformation
between
the
two
rings.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-2	sentence=2
However
,
the
second
assumption
was
greatly
challenged
by
our
recent
studies
of
N-naphthalene
triazoles.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-2	sentence=3
As

On
the
basis
of
these

,
planar
intramolecular
charge

(

was
proposed
as
a
plausible
mechanism

the

the

was
conﬁrmed

,
according

the

is

were

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-5	sentence=1
Similar
to
phenyl
triazoles
,
N-1
isomer
1d
gave
no
ﬂuorescence
emission
,
and
the
N-2
isomer
1c
gave
strong
emission.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-5	sentence=2
However
,
a
closer
look
at
1c
suggests
that
coplanar
conformation
between
naphthalene
and
the
triazole
ring
is
highly
unlikely
due
to
steric
repulsion.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-5	sentence=3
In
fact
,
the
crystal
structure
of
a
similar
analogue
indicated
a
49.5
°
dihedral
angle
between
the
two
rings
in
the
N-2
isomer.5
These
results
piqued
our
interest
in
further
exploring
this
new
class
of
dyes
by
questioning
whether
the
coplanar
conformation
is
necessary.6
Besides
coplanar
intramolecular
charge
transfer
(
PICT
)
,
another
feasible
photochemical
process
associated
with
this
type
of
extended
aromatic
ring
,
twisted
intramolecular
charge
transfer
(
TICT
)
,
was
ﬁrst
introduced
by
Grabowski
and
co-
workers.7
One
important
feature
of
the
TICT
type
of
emission
is
the
feasibility
of
the
donor
unit
in
initiating
the
charge
transfer.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-5	sentence=4
A
number
of
nitrogen

containing
heterocycles
have
been
studied
as
donors
in
TICT
-
emitting
molecules.8
However
,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
1,2,3-triazoles
have
never
been
used
as
a
potential
donor
in
TICT
ﬂuorophores
,
and
their
photochemical
properties
are
unknown
.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-6	sentence=0
To
explore
triazole
derivatives
as
potential
TICT
-
emitting
dyes
,
we
prepared
anthracene
-
substituted
triazole
1e
(
N-2
)
and
1f
(
N-1
).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-6	sentence=1
Clearly
,
the
anthracene
should
provide
a
large
enough
the
coplanar
steric
repulsion
to
prevent
conformation
even
in
the
N-2
isomer
1e.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-6	sentence=2
Thus
,
the
ﬂuorescence
emission
should
be
mainly
from
the
twisted
state.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-6	sentence=3
Interestingly
,
both
N-1
and
N-2
isomers
gave
good
emissions.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-6	sentence=4
However
,
three
diﬀerent
emission
bands
were
observed
in
N-1
isomer
1f
,
which
was
similar
to
the
typical
emission
of
aromatic
-
substituted
anthracene.9
This
result
suggested
that
triazole-anthracene
compounds
were
not
good
model
molecules
to
access
the
triazole
’s
inﬂuence
on
TICT
emission
due
to
the
notable
background
emission
from
anthracene.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-6	sentence=5
To
better
evaluate
the
triazole
inﬂuence
in
the
twisted
systems
,
we
designed
naphthalene
-
bridged
bis-triazole
(
NBT
)
.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-7	sentence=0
As
shown
by
the
crystal
structures
,
both
bis-triazole
NBT
3
and
mono-triazole
4
adopted
a
twisted
conformation.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-7	sentence=1
However
,
whereas
N-2
isomers
generally
gave
good
ﬂuorescence
emission
,
the
N-1
isomers
gave
almost
no
emission
in
all
cases.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-7	sentence=2
The
emission
intensity
of
NBT
3
followed
a
clear
trend
in
that
N2−N2
>
N2−N1
>
N1−N1
(
almost
no
emission
).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-7	sentence=3
Because
of
the
rotation
strain
,
it
is
impossible
for
NBT
3
to
adopt
planar
conformation
even
in
solution.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00006-7	sentence=4
Thus
,
the
observed
good
ﬂuorescence
emission
of
the
N-2
isomers
likely
represents
the
photochemical
process
associated
with
TICT
states.

The

established
that
heterolytic
cleavage
dominates
the
chemistry
of
IN3
,
such
that
it
reacts
predominantly
as
a
source
of
I+
,
but
BrN3
and
ClN3
can
be
directed
along
ionic
(
heterolytic
)
or
radical
(
homolytic
)
pathways
by
changing
the
reaction
conditions.12,17
Polar

favor
ionic

for

substrates
,
while
nonpolar
solvents
and
the

to

INTRODUCTION
Direct
asymmetric
α-function
of
carbonyl
compounds
with
β-
trans-nitroalkenes
has
been
studied
in
detail
as
a
classic
transformation
and
fundamental
approach
in
developing
novel
chiral
catalysts
and
aﬀording
useful
optical
moleculars
bearing
two
typical
functional
groups.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-1	sentence=1
Over
the
past
decade
,
tremendous
methods
involving
various
type
of
carbonyl
compounds
have
been
devoted
to
realizing
the
asymmetric
C
−
C
bond
formation
process
with
β-trans-nitroalkenes.1
It
is
well
-
known
that
aldehydes,2
ketones,3
ketoesters,4
and
types
of
cyclic
carbonyl
compounds5
have
been
reported
as
powerful
nucleophiles
in
the
direct
asymmetric
conjugate
addition
with
nitroalkenes.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-1	sentence=2
However
,
in
comparison
with
the
well
-
documented
studies
of
α-carbon
type
nucleophiles
,
the
reaction
with
the
utility
of
α-
heteroatom
nucleophiles
,
especially
for
simple
linear
aldehydes6
and
ketones,7,8
has
not
been
studied
as
extensively
(

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-1	sentence=3
On
the
basis
of
our
recent
work
on
the
application
of
N-
phenyl-imidazole-modiﬁed
ketones
in
asymmetric
Michael
reaction
with
β-nitroalkenes
by

a
newly

3-bromothiophene-modiﬁed
chiral
diamine
ligand,9

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-2	sentence=0
and

metal
-
mediated
asymmetric
reactions,10
here
we
report
a
relatively
general
method
of
N-phenyl-imidazole-modiﬁed
α-
heteroatom
ketones
in
enantioselective
conjugate
reaction
with
β-nitroalkenes.

RESULTS
AND
DISCUSSION
As
illustrated
in
Scheme
2
,
the
imidazole-modiﬁed
α-heteroatom
ketones
could
be
easily
prepared
by
simple
substitution
reactions
of
α-chloroketone
1a
with
diﬀerent
phenols
,
acids
,
thiophenols
,
and
thiols.11

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-3	sentence=0
Having
built
the
synthetic
method
of
types
of
imidazole-
modiﬁed
α-heteroatom
ketones
,
we
next
evaluated
the
conjugate
reaction
of
ketone
1b
with
β-trans-nitroalkenes
2a
using
the
diamine
/
Ni(OAc)2
catalysts
prepared
from
chiral
diamine
ligands
and
Ni(OAc)2
in
a
1
:
1
ratio.12
As
the
results
show
in
Table
1
,
serials
of
chiral
diamine
derivatives
(
Scheme
3
)
were
screened
to
eﬀect
the
desired
conjugate
reaction.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-3	sentence=1
A
3-
bromothiophene-modiﬁed
chiral
diamine
ligand
L7
was
proven
to
be
better
at
introducing
highly
enantioselectivity
as
compared
to
other
diamine
units
(
Table

,
entries
1
−
10
).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-3	sentence=2
Solvent

from
THF
to
DCM
,
iPrOH
,
and
dioxane
did
not
give
more
potential
results
(
Table
1
,
entries
11
−
13
).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-3	sentence=3
Changing
the
reaction
’s
concentration
from
0.2
to
0.05
M
would
slightly
decrease
the
ee
values
(
Table
1
,
entries
14
and
15
).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-3	sentence=4
Further
screening
process
displayed
that
the
reactions
carried
out
under
0
°
C
could
enhance
the
result
and
further
selection
process
of
additives
found
the
introduction
of
4
Å
MS
into
the
reaction
would
improve
the
ee
value
to
97
%
(
Table

,
entries
16
−
21
).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-3	sentence=5
To
our
delight
,
the
reaction
could
also
proceed
smoothly
with

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-4	sentence=0
After
the
optimized
conditions
were
established
as
afore-
mentioned
,
the
substrate
generality
of
the
N-phenylimidazole-
modiﬁed
α-thioketones
with
an
array
of
β-nitroalkenes
was
examined.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-4	sentence=1
As
illustrated
in
Table
2
,
a
serials
of
aromatic
nitroalkenes
were
tested
in
the
conjugate
reaction
,
and
the
corresponding
adducts
3a−3j
were
obtained
in
good
to
excellent
yields
and
enantioselectivities
(
Table

).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-4	sentence=2
For
heterocyclic
substrates
,
such
as
2-furyl-
and
2-thienyl-derived
nitroalkenes
,
the
conjugate
products
were
obtained
in
decreased
diaster-
eoselectivities
while
maintaining
a
high
level
of
ee
values
,
respectively
(
Table

,
3k,3l
).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-4	sentence=3
Two
representative
aliphatic
β-
nitroalkenes
were
also
tried
in
the
conjugate
reaction
;
the
desired
adducts
could
be
obtained
in
relatively
lower
diastereoselectiv-
ities
(
Table

with
respect
to

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-5	sentence=0
diﬀerent
types
of
α-thioketones
then
was
also
investigated
(
Table
2
).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-5	sentence=1
As
the
results
show
in
the
table
,
ketones
equipped
with
diﬀerent
benzylthio
groups
could
also
be
applied
to
the
catalytic
asymmetric
conjugate
reactions.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-5	sentence=2
The
desired
conjugate
adducts
3o
,
3p
,
and
3q
were
smoothly
generated
in
moderate
diastereoselectivities
and
excellent
enantioselectivities
,
respec-
tively.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-5	sentence=3
The
use
of
an
α-ethanethioketone
also
led
to
good
results
,
and
the
absolute
stereochemistry
of
the
corresponding
product
3r
was
unambiguously
determined
to
be
(
S,S
)
by
X-ray
crystallographic
analysis,13
bearing
the
same
absolute
conﬁg-
uration
of
our
previous
studies
of
carbon
substituent
N-
phenylimidazole-modiﬁed
ketones
in
conjugate
reactions
with
β-nitroalkenes.9
Additionally
,
2-hydroxyethanethiol
was
also
an
alternative
sulfur
source
for
this
catalytic
system
,
aﬀording
the
desired
conjugate
adduct
3s
with
acceptable
results
.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-6	sentence=0
Encouraged
by
the
above
results
obtained
from
the
α-
thioketones
,
we
next
focused
our
attention
on
the
adaptability
of
N-phenylimidazole-modiﬁed
α-oxyketones
in
this
asymmetric
conjugate
reaction.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-6	sentence=1
To
our
delight
,
the
conjugate
reaction
proceeded
smoothly
for
the
α-oxyketones.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-6	sentence=2
As
the
results
show
in
Table
3
,
aromatic
nitroalkenes
bearing
either
electron
-
deﬁcient
or
electron
-
rich
substituents
are
equally
applicable
,
and
generated
the
desired
adducts
in
good
to
excellent
diaster-
eoselectivities
and
enantioselectivities
(
Table
3
,
4a−4m
).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-6	sentence=3
To
be
noted
,
aromatic
nitroalkenes
with
ortho-substituents
or
hetero-
cyclic
groups
displayed
relative
lower
diastereoselectivities.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-6	sentence=4
Also
,
aliphatic
β-nitroalkenes
that
were
also
tolerable
in
the
conjugate
reaction
resulted
in
moderate
yields
and
good
diastereoselectiv-
ities
and
enantioselectivities
(
Table
3
,
4n,4o
).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-6	sentence=5
Furthermore
,
the
use
of
diﬀerent
α-oxyketones
also
led
to
good
results
,
and
the
desired
products
4p−4s
were
obtained
in
good
yields
and
ee
values.

It
is
notable
that
an

could
be
applied
to
the
conjugated
reaction
and
generated
the
corresponding
product
4t
smoothly
with
good
results
,
while
the
ketone
equipped
with
a
benzoate
group
can
not
perform
the
transformation
and
no
desired
product
4u
was
detected
by
TLC

analysis
and
1H
NMR
studies
,
and
we
have
not
found
any
side
reactions
and
the
relative
starting
materials
could
be
recovered.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-7	sentence=1
We
next
explored
the
application
of
the
α-chloroketone
1a
in
this
reaction.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-7	sentence=2
We
found
the
related
conjugate
adducts
could
be
formed
smoothly
and
resulted
in
acceptable
diastereoselectivities
and
good
to
excellent
enantioselectivities
(
Table

).

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-7	sentence=3
The
major
diastereoisomer
’s
absolute
conﬁguration
was
determined
to
be
(
S,S
)
by
X-ray
crystallographic
analysis.13

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-8	sentence=0
Next
,
some
further
transformations
of
the
conjugate
products
have
been
carried
out.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-8	sentence=1
As
shown
in
Scheme
4
,
the
conjugate
adduct
3a
and
4a
could
be
transformed
into
esters
after
the
cleavage
of
the
N-phenylimidazole
group
with
the
corresponding
alcohols.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-8	sentence=2
It
should
be
noted
the
the
diastereoselectivities
of
the
product
would
be
dramatically
dropped
in
the
presence
of
1,8-
diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-8	sentence=3
So
it
is
obvious
that
the
reverse
process
of
diastereoselectivity
easily
occurred
when
the
heteroatom
was
equipped
in
adducts.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-8	sentence=4
To
our
delight
,
the
adduct
5a
could
be
easily
transformed
into
cyclopropane
derivatives
after
treating
it
with
a
simple
base
such
as
potassium
carbonate
,
and
the
relative
stereochemistry
of
8
and
9
was
determined
by
NOESY
analysis15
(
Scheme
5
)
.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-9	sentence=0
Finally
,
a
possible
mechanism
for
this
Ni(II)
-
catalyzed
conjugate
reaction
is
proposed
in
Scheme
6.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-9	sentence=1
After
the
enolization
process
of
the
α-heteroatom
ketone
and
the
coordination
results
determined
by
the
chiral
environment
of
the
catalyst
,
the
conjugate
reaction
would
occur
between
the
activated
ketone
and
nitroalkenes.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00013-9	sentence=2
On
the
basis
of
the
absolute
stereochemistry
of
the
conjugate
products
,
we
speculated
the
in
situ
generated
(Z)-
enolate
should
be
more
stable
than
(E)-enolate
due
to
the
sterically
hindered
eﬀects
between
the
imidazole
group
and
the
heteroatoms
.

ABSTRACT
:
A
copper
-
catalyzed
direct
ring
-
opening
double
N-arylation
of
benzoxazoles
with
aryl
iodides
has
been
developed.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00019-0	sentence=1
The
present
system
exhibits
high
selectivity
despite
competition
from
C-arylation.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00019-0	sentence=2
The
selectivity
between
ring
-
opening
N-
arylation
and
C-arylation
was
controlled
by
the
choice
of
reaction
vessel.

#	passage=10.1021/acs.joc.5b00019-0	sentence=3
The
nitrile
bound
bis(triphenylphosphine)copper
cyanide
was
identiﬁed
as
the
active
catalytic
species
for
both
reactions
,
and
when
combined
with
a
nitrile
-
containing
solvent
,
enhanced
the
reaction
eﬃciency
.
