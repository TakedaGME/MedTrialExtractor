in the presence of Bu3P ( 10 mol % ) in DMF at room temperature for 48 h aﬀorded the (E)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1- one 4a in the yield of 42 % accompanied by 3a-hydroxy- isoxazolo[3,2-a]isoindol-8(3aH)-one derivative 3 in the yield of 48 % ( entry 1 , Table 1 ).
It was interesting to note that 3a- hydroxyisoxazolo[3,2-a]isoindol-8(3aH)-one derivative 3 was not found and the (E)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 4a was formed in good yield beside a little amount of (Z)-3- methyleneisoindolin-1-one 5a when the loading of the catalyst Bu3P was increased to 20 or 50 mol % ( entries 2 and 3 , Table 1 ).
To our delight , an excelent yield of 5a was obtained when the reaction was carried out at 150 ° C ( entry 8 , Table 1 ).
It is highlighted here that only (E)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1- one 4a was given in 73 % yield when the reaction was performed in DMF at 60 ° C for 4 h using inorganic base K2CO3 as catalyst , and the sole product 5a was formed in 74 %
We found that compound 3a could be eﬀectively transformed to (E)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 4a in the presence of a catalytic amount of both K2CO3 and Bu3P at 60 ° C , while it was fully transformed to (Z)-3-methylene- isoindolin-1-one 5a at 150 ° C in the presence of Bu3P or at 100 ° C in the presence of K2CO3.
We also found that (E)-3- methyleneisoindolin-1-one 4a could be eﬀectively transformed to (Z)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 5a in the presence of a catalytic amount of both K2CO3 and Bu3P at a higher temperature , which shows a novel example that the (E)- conﬁguration of the carbon − carbon double bond could be transformed to the (Z)-conﬁguration of the carbon − carbon double bond.
It is worth mentioning here that compound 3a could also be transformed to (E)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 4a and (Z)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 5a in the absence of catalyst , and compound 4a could also be transformed to its isomer 5a.

ylidene)acetate ( 6 ) was formed in 90 % yield when the reaction was performed in DMF at 150 ° C for 2 h in the presence of Bu3P , while the (E)-ethyl 2-(5,6-dichloro-3-oxoisoindolin-1- ylidene)acetate ( 7 ) was formed in 65 % yield when K2CO3 was used as catalyst in DMF at 60 ° C for 2 h ( Scheme 3 ) .

BrN3 was ﬁrst synthesized from Br2 gas and −HCl− solid NaN3,3 which was modiﬁed by Hassner [ Br2 NaN3]10,13,18 into a somewhat hazardous procedure that nevertheless achieved some subsequent use.50−52 Other approaches have involved the in situ generation of toxic and explosive hydrazoic acid [ NXS − HN3 , X = I , Br ] ; 53,54 the use of Br2 solution in the presence of sodium azide under neutral or basic conditions55,56 avoids that particular hazard , albeit with diminished yields and the formation of other side products.
The latter species either undergoes rearrangement reaction with dissolved oxygen , producing peroxynitrous acid (ONO2H)86 ( Scheme 1 ).
Methylindole-6-carboxylate ( 10 ) was con- verted to the corresponding 3,3-dichlorolactam 10a in excellent yield , implicating hypochlorite as an oxidant as well as a source of chloride radical.
Similarly , 7-azaindole ( 11 ) gave only 3- chloro-1H-pyrollo[2,3-b]pyridine ( 11a ).

10 β-Ketoamide 2d aﬀorded desired product 3ad in a rather low yield11 at an extended reaction time of 30 h , possibly because a decrease in the nucleophilicity of the methylene moiety by an the amino group hindered the electron - donating eﬀect of reaction of It was remarkable , however , that when the condensation was carried out with malonic acid ( 2e ) , 2-benzylidene-malonic acid ( 3ae ) was obtained in 79 % yield without a Doebner - type decarbox- ylation.12 Also , when the reaction of malononitrile ( 2f ) was carried out in toluene , only 15 % ( NMR yield ) of the product was obtained.
When the condensation of 1a with the cyclic 1,3-diketone dimedone ( 2g ) was conducted under the optimal conditions , 1 : 2 adduct 7 ( a xanthenedione derivative ) was isolated as the sole product , which otherwise would have been produced via a further Michael addition of 2g to the ﬁrst Knoevenagel adduct and a subsequent intramolecular cyclodehydration.7g
When 4-formylpyridine ( 8a ) was used as a substrate , the corresponding alkene product 9aa was obtained in 65 % yield ( entry 1 ).
When the reactions of either a pyridyl aldehyde , which have a more sterically hindered portion around the nitrogen atom , 2-bromo-6-formylpyridine ( 8b ) , or 2-thiophenyl aldehyde ( 8c ) with malonate ester 2a were treated with our optimal conditions , the extended π-conjugate heteroaromatic compounds 9ba and 9ca were obtained in good yields ( entries 2 and 3 ).
For example , a conjugated aldehyde , (E)-cinnamal- dehyde ( 8d ) , reacted with the malonate ester to aﬀord α , β , γ , δ-unsaturated carbonyl compound 9da in 79 % yield , which retained the double - bond geometry ( entry 4 ).
The reactions of linear aliphatic aldehydes 8e and 8f were completed within 24 h to give the corresponding products 9ea and 9fa in good yields ( entries 5 and 6 ).
In the former reaction , the cor- responding geminal diacetate 4a was quickly obtained in 91 % yield at room temperature , but in the latter reaction , no formation of diacetate 4a nor any other byproducts were ob- served.
Consequently , Knoevenagel adduct 3aa was obtained in 79 % yield in the presence of a catalytic amount of InCl3 , but the reaction with- out the indium catalyst did not produce the corresponding product along with the recovery of starting diacetate 4a ( eq 2 in Scheme 1 ).
As shown in Scheme 4 , the conjugate adduct 3a and 4a could be transformed into esters after the cleavage of the N-phenylimidazole group with the corresponding alcohols.

In the optimized condition ( entry 9 in Table 1 ) , the reaction was performed in a screw- capped vial , and formed the ring - opened double - arylated product 3aa , as the sole product.
However , by changing the reaction vessel from a closed , and assuming pressured , screw- capped vial to an open round - bottomed ﬂask , the C-arylated product 4aa was the major product and isolated in high yields
Both 3aa ( 59 % ) and 4aa ( 16 % ) were obtained from condition B in DMF at 150 ° C.
Interestingly , a mixture of copper triphenylphosphine , and base converted benzoxazole to 2-aminophenol with higher yield ( 62 % ) , indicating that the copper catalyst can also aﬀect the ring - opening of benzoxazole.
We found the best reaction conditions comprising the reaction of substrate 1a , aryl iodide 2a , and AgOAc ( additive ) in the presence 5 or 10 mol % of the Pd(OAc)2 catalyst , which aﬀorded the C3 - arylated product , cis 2,3-disubstituted tetrahydrofuran 3a ( norlignan analogue ) , in 70 and 81 % yields , respectively ( entries 3 and 4 , Table 1 ).
Ag2CO3 as an additive instead of AgOAc also gave the product 3a in 69 % yield ( entry 5 , Table 1 ).
The Pd - catalyzed C(3)−H arylation of substrate 1a with 2a in the presence of various other additives , such as K2CO3 or KOAc or PhI(OAc)2 did not give the product 3a ( entries 6 − 8 , Table 1 ).
However , the C − H arylation of 1a in the presence of Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 and Pd(PPh3)4 instead of Pd(OAc)2 furnished the product 3a in 69 and 30 % yields , respectively ( entries 11 and 12 , Table 1 ).
The Pd - catalyzed C − H arylation of 1a with 2a in other solvents , such as MeCN or 1,2-DCE or tert-butyl alcohol , failed to aﬀord the product 3a ( entries 13− 15 , Table 1 ).
However , the Pd - catalyzed reaction of 1a with 2a in 1,4-dioxane or tert-amyl alcohol gave the product 3a in 46 and 57 % yields , respectively ( entries 16 and 17 , Table 1 ).
arylation of substrate 1a with 1 equiv of 2a gave the C3 - arylated product 3a in low yield ( 35 % , entry 1 , Table 2 ).

The usage of 4 equiv of 2a gave the C3 - arylated product 3a in very good yield ( 81 % , entry 4 , Tables 1 and 2 ).
Along this line , we have also performed the Pd - catalyzed C − H arylation of substrate 1a with 1.8 equiv of 2a by using Bull ’s reaction conditions,15c which gave the C3 - arylated product 3a in 50 % yield ( Table 2 ).
Similarly , the C3- arylated THF scaﬀolds 3h and 3i were obtained from the Pd-
Then we performed the reaction of the substrate 1g with phenyl iodide in the presence of AgOAc ( 2.2 equiv ) and 10 mol % of the Pd(OAc)2 catalyst , which successfully gave the C3 - arylated product , cis 2,3-disubstituted 1,4-benzodioxane scaﬀold 4a ( neolignan analogue ) , in 65 % yield ( Scheme 3 ).
Thenceforth , we capitalized on this success and synthesized a wide range neolignan - type cis 2,3-disubstituted 1,4-benzodioxane scaﬀolds 4b − q ( 40 − 83 % ) from Pd - catalyzed direct arylation of the methylene sp3 C(3)−H bond of the 1,4-benzodioxane system 1g by using the corresponding aryl iodides , such as mono- and
The X-ray structure of the representative compound 4p ( see SI for the X-ray structure of 4p16 ) clearly conﬁrmed that the C − H arylation of the substrate 1g was highly regio- and stereoselective and the direct C − H arylation occurred only at the C3 - position of the substrate 1g and selectively gave the 2,3-disubstituted 1,4-benzodioxanes 4a − q with cis stereo- chemistry ( C2 and C3 stereocenters ).
Similarly , the C − H arylation of substrates 1h and 1i with 2-iodothiophene gave the products 5h ( 2R,3S , major isomer ) and 6h ( 2S,3R , major isomer ) in 81 and 90 % yields , respectively ( Scheme 4 ).
that the C − H arylation of the chiral substrates 1h and 1i resulted the chiral products 5a − h with ee 81 to > 99 % and 6a− h with ee 83 to > 99 % , and perceptibly , partial racemizations were observed in most of the reactions under the experimental conditions.
The direct C − H arylation of chiral substrates 1h and 1i occurred only at the C3 - position and selectively gave the chiral 2,3-disubstituted tetrahydrofurans 5a − h and 6a − h with cis stereochemistry ( C2 and C3 stereocenters ).
This reaction gave the C3 - arylated product 3b in 70 % yield ( Scheme 5 ).

Thus , selective protection of the primary hydroxy the diol 20 with TESCl / imidazole yielded the group of secondary alcohol , which was subjected to the TPAP oxidation19 to aﬀord ketone 23 ( Scheme 7 ).
Diastereoselective reduction of 23 with NaBH4 proceeded successfully to provide the desired alcohol 24 in 98 % yield as the sole diastereomer.
TES protection of the resulting secondary hydroxy moiety of 24 , followed by selective removal of the primary TES group , yielded alcohol 25.
Oxidation of 25 13 and subsequent removal of the with TEMPO / PhI(OAc)2 PMB group gave unsaturated aldehyde 26 in 82 % yield in two steps.
Stepwise deprotection of 26 , that is , removal of the 17 and the TES group by HF·pyr , acetonide moiety by TiCl4 furnished the second target molecule 2b .
Treatment of the β-hydroxy 20 furnished the desired anti-diol ketone 11 with NaBH(OAc)3 27 in 95 % yield as a single diastereomer , as judged by its 1H NMR spectrum , which was clearly diﬀerent from that of the syn-diol 14.
Further transformation of 27 toward 2c was similar to that used in the synthesis of 2a.
The diol 28 was transformed to unsaturated aldehyde 29 by the following four - step sequence : ( 1 ) bis-silylation , ( 2 ) selective desilylation of the primary TES moiety , ( 3 ) TEMPO oxidation13 of the allylic alcohol , and ( 4 ) removal of the PMB group.
The alcohol 28 , which was the key synthetic intermediate toward 2c , was converted to ketone 30 through the selective silylation of the primary alcohol and TPAP oxidation19 of the secondary alcohol.
The ketone 30 was reduced with NaBH4 to give alcohol 31 as the sole diastereomer.
Acetonide 32 , which was synthesized from the alcohol 31 in 54 % overall yield

The intermediate 14f , with the bulkier TIPS group , was also easily transformed by this route into the desired aldehyde 17a.
Compound 24 was acetylated under standard conditions , aﬀording diacetate 25 in pure form , and then the acylsilane moiety was transformed to the aldehyde 26 in very good yield , showing that the used procedure was compatible with more complex structures .

After protection as its TBS ether , the transformation of acylsilane 34 into aldehyde 35 was successfully performed using the same photolytic conditions.
This derivative is already a known intermediate for the total synthesis of Panamycin 607,26a and Gephyronic acid.26b A second tandem aldol reaction gave , after separation of the diastereoisomers by silica gel chromatography , intermediate 36 as the major isomer.
This was followed immediately by in situ reduction with NaBH4 and aqueous workup to aﬀord diol 37 in 70 % yield from 36.
1a,19 These precursors 3 are prepared by base - induced condensation of the correspond- ing 2-bromo(het)aryl acetonitriles 1 with (het)aryl dithioesters 2 followed by in situ S - methylation of the resulting enethiolate intermediates ( Scheme 1 ) .
5a , which was obtained in 95 % yield by condensation of 1a with 2a in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride in DMF as solvent ( Table 1 ).
ligand , and NaH as base in DMF as solvent when the reaction was complete within 3 h at 90 ° C , furnishing the benzothio- phene 4a in 92 % yield ( entry 12 ).
Thus , in situ generated enethiolate 5a ( from 1a and dithioester 2a in the presence of sodium hydride and DMF ) was subjected to intramolecular arylthiolation by adding CuI ( 10 mol % ) and L-proline ( 20 mol % ) to the reaction mixture and further heating at 90 ° C.
Monitoring of the reaction mixture revealed that the reaction was complete within 3 h , providing benzothiophene 4a in comparable yield of 90 % ( Table 2 , entry 1 ).
The resulting acid chloride 7 was then condensed in situ with the substituted trimethylsilyl acetylenes to furnish the corresponding α,β-acetylenic ketones 8 ( Scheme 2 ) .
Although this work deals mainly with the synthesis of the title compound , pyrazolo-pyrrolo-pyrazines 1 , we reacted compound 8a with AuCl3 in a mixture of MeOH / CH3CN at room temperature and observed the formation of an eight- membered heterocycle 9 in 77 % yield after chromatographic puriﬁcation ( Scheme 3 ).
Aminopyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazinium mesitylenesulfonate 3 was reacted with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate ( DMAD ) to give the dihydro derivative 4 , which was oxidized to 5 ( Scheme 1 ).
Interestingly , we found that hydrazine monohydrate reduces pyrazole 11a to 12 in the presence of air without any catalyst or metal ( Scheme 5 ).

In the next step , the gold species is removed by a proton to give ﬁnal products 13 and 14 .
The reaction of 11a − h with NaH in N,N- dimethylformamide ( DMF ) at room temperature gave exclusively 6-exo-dig heterocyclization products 13a − h.
12 Since the central carbon atom in the allene moiety is more electropositive , a nitrogen atom from the pyrazole ring attacks exclusively this carbon atom , giving rise to the formation of 6-exo-dig cyclization products 13 ( Table 3 ) .
It is probable that hydrazine acts as a base and isomerizes the alkyne unit in 19 to the corresponding allene 20 , which undergoes an intra- molecular 6-exo-trig cyclization reaction to give the isolated product 21.22 We assume that the pyridine ring , an electron- deﬁcient aromatic ring , is responsible for isomerization of the alkyne unit into the corresponding allene moiety.
The isomer- ization of 21 into 22 was accomplished with DBU at room
The best result was obtained from a reaction of 1a ( 1.0 equiv , 0.2 mmol ) with 2a ( 1.5 equiv ) using Rh2(Oct)4 ( 2.0 mol % ) in ethyl acetate at 120 ° C for 16 h , producing ethyl 3-(4- nitrophenyl)-5-phenylpyrazine-2-carboxylate ( 3aa ) in 70 % isolated yield ( entry 10 ).
When the present reaction was conducted with Rh2(OAc)4 ( 2.0 mol % ) at or below 100 ° C , dihydropyrazines 4 and 5 were produced ( entries 8 and 9 ).
For example , N-4-methoxybenze- nesulfonyl-4-aryl-1,2,3-triazoles ( 2 ) having electron - donating 3- methyl , 4-methyl , 2-methoxy , and 3-methoxy groups on the phenyl ring underwent the Rh - catalyzed reactions , aﬀording the desired pyrazines ( 3ab , 3ac , 3ad , and 3ae ) in good yields ranging from 70 % to 74 % .
17 In addition , the reactions of substrates with electron - withdrawing 3-chloro , 4-chloro , 3- bromo , and 4-bromo groups on the phenyl ring provided the cyclization products ( 3af , 3ag , 3ah , and 3ai ) in moderate to good yields ranging from 51 % to 81 % .

Finally , elimination of arylsulﬁnic acid from 5 produces pyrazine 3.
6π-Electrocyclization ( pathway a ) of 1,4-diazatriene D might be involved to the formation of dihydropyrazine 5.
To our delight , the C − C bond - forming reaction proceeded , but surprisingly , the observed product was not the originally expected 3aa-O but the formally dehydrative coupling product 3aa ( entry 1 ).
The control experiment with the parent quinoline under otherwise identical conditions resulted in no formation of 3aa ( entry 18 ).
Just one exception is 2-methylpyr- idine N-oxide , and the corresponding product 3ka was detected in only 4 % yield.
Moreover , the reaction of 1a with 2a could be successfully performed on a 1.0 mmol scale , and 3aa was obtained in 43 % yield .
Among other 1,3-azoles , only N-methylbenzimidazole gave the corresponding biaryl 3bj , albeit with 28 % yield.
Nevertheless , we can not completely exclude the possibility of the stepwise dehydrogenative C-H / C-H coupling / deoxygena- tion mechanism19 such as the dehydrogenative coupling product 3aa-O , which was inde- pendently prepared from 3aa and mCPBA,20 readily underwent deoxygenation in the presence of 2.0 equiv Cu(OAc)2 to furnish 3aa in quantitative yield ( Scheme 7 ).
When methyl ester 3a was reacted with lithiated α-(trimethylsilyl)methylphosphonate 2 , no reaction occurred at − 78 ° C ( Table 1 , entry 1 ) ; however , raising the temperature to − 40 or − 20 ° C aﬀorded β‑ketophosphonate 4 in 39 % and 78 % yield , respectively ( Table 1 , entries 2 and 3 ).

Treatment of 12 with DBU in reﬂuxing CH3CN furnished the 3′-O-acetylated 2,5′-anhydro nucleoside 13 ( 79 % ) , which after treatment with K2CO3 in MeOH gave 8 ( 86 % ) ( Scheme 2 ).
Finally , treatment of 8 with saturated NH3 / MeOH aﬀorded nucleoside 1c .
Indeed , concentrated aqueous NH3 ( 1 : 3 ) at room temperature kept the main amount of 1c intact with only a small amount of formation of the faster migrating side product 14 ( Figure 2b ).
Control experiments revealed that a photocatalyst , 4 and visible light were essential for the eﬃcient conversion of 1a into 2a ( entries 7 − 10 ).

Pleasingly , the chemoselective debromination of 1i prepared from diene 1115 delivered a 10 : 1 separable mixture of 16 and 2i′ in a combined yield of 79 % without touching the phenylthio group when the reaction was carried out in the absence of nBu3N ( Scheme 3 ).
Subsequent irreversible hydrogen atom transfer from the radical cation 12 to this electron deﬁcient intermediate 14 would generate the trans- fused bicyclic 2 and the pyridine byproduct 15.

The discrepancy between conversion and yield ( Table 1 ) is mainly explained by the formation of two side products : the bis(3-indolyl)methane species 4 and tryptophol ( 5 ).
The bis(indole) 4 , arising from indole to the transient azafulvene,14 did not addition of undergo conversion to 3a under the reaction conditions , but some degradation of 4 did take place , suggesting that 4 is not a the plausible intermediate of
Most importantly , we discovered that when powdered Cs2CO3 was used as the base , the desired N- acetyltryptamine was obtained in a synthetically useful yield ( Table 1 , entry 16 ).
Interestingly , using N-Cbz-ethanolamine , we obtained only 3-benzylindole , which probably formed by the borrowing hydrogen reaction of indole with benzyl alcohol generated by an intramolecular cyclization to the corresponding oxazolidinone.

In the ﬁrst , a tandem Mizoroki − Heck reaction and double - bond isomerization between a previously known allyl alcohol intermediate and a hindered 2-(2-halophenyl)propan-2-ol secured direct access to the 3-(2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)phenyl)-1- phenylpropan-1-one moiety in the product.
A signiﬁcant drawback of this approach is the methyl Grignard reagent addition to the aryl ester 5 that leads to the dimethyl aryl carbinol 6.
The acetate 12 proved to be a reactive partner in the Mizoroki − Heck reaction with allyl alcohol 3 , and in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 and P(o-tol)3 , the desired acetate - protected keto-carbinol 13 was obtained , albeit with varying amounts of an isomeric impurity ( Table 1 ).

protected 2-vinylindole 1j was utilized as a substrate instead of N-unprotected substrate 1a , which could also aﬀord the corresponding spiro - product 3ja but in an obviously diminished yield and stereoselectivity.
This phenomenon indicated that the N-benzoyl group of 2d might compete with the amide group of the indolinone moiety to form a hydrogen bond with CPA , and the N-H group of 2e might also disturb the hydrogen - bonding interaction between the N-H group of 1a and the catalyst , thus resulting in the reduced enantioselectivities of spiro - products 3ad and 3ae .

Additionally , dihydronaphthalenes 29b and 31b were obtained in 15 % and 56 % yields , respectively for styrene − yne 30 ( entries 2 and 3 , Table 1 ).
Notably , containing a tosylamide tether , the dihydronaphthalene product 31b was formed as the major product.
Increasing the reaction temperature to 225 ° C resulted in a reversal of selectivity , giving a 1 : 1.5 ratio of 31b:31a ( entry 6 ).
Irradiating styrene− yne 30 at 180 ° C in DCE either under air or after degassing the reaction mixture with argon both generated a 1.9 : 1 mixture of dihydronaphthalene 31b to naphthalene 31a in as little as 2 min ( see Table S1 ( Supporting Information ) for a complete listing of experimental conditions employed ).

As expected , heating 42 in DMF under the same reaction conditions resulted in a 70 % combined yield of 45 and 46 in a 1 : 7 ratio ; however , dihydronaphthalene 46 was now generated with a much greater diastereoselectivity of 14 : 1 for the opposite diastereomer ( Scheme 4 ).
conditions of triphenylphosphine , diisopropyl azodicarboxylate , and 4-methyl-N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)benzenesulfonamide ( 34 ) gave styrene − yne 35 in 85 % yield.36 N-Methoxy-N-methyl- acetamide ( 36 ) was then employed to acylate the lithium acetylide of 35 , providing 46 % yield of alkynone 37.37
The pentadeuterated substrates 42 and 43 were prepared in a similar manner as 37 ; however , the synthesis began by a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of bromobenzene-d5 ( 38 ) with propargyl alcohol ( 39 ) in the presence of tetrakis- (triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) , copper(I) iodide , and pyrrolidine to generate 50 % yield of 3-(phenyl-d5)prop-2-yn- 1-ol ( Scheme 3 ).
Subsequent reduction of the alkyne using lithium aluminum hydride produced cinnamyl alcohol 40 in 56 % yield.
Mitsunobu reaction conditions were utilized for the conversion of 40 to styrene − yne 41 in 86 % yield.
Finally , to the lithium acetylide of 41 was added either N-methoxy-N- methylacetamide ( 36 ) or methyl chloroformate , producing alkynone 42 and alkynoate 43 in 80 or 55 % yield , respectively .
As a result of our mechanistic studies , we postulate that dihydronaphthalene formation occurs via an initial [ 4 + 2 ] cycloaddition reaction of 30 to produce the tetraene 50 ( Scheme 6A ).
Next , 52 abstracts a hydrogen atom from another equivalent of 50 to give dihydronaphthalene 31b , along with an additional radical 51 / 52 which will propagate the reaction.

Utilization of standard IMDDA reaction conditions , along with 1,4-cyclohexadiene ( 10 equiv ) , aﬀorded a similar yield and 1 : 1.2 ratio of 31a and 31b when compared to reaction mixtures in which 1,4-cyclohexadiene was not present ( Scheme 7 ).
excess (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl ( TEMPO , 1.5 equiv ) resulted in a 52 % yield of 31a ; 31b and the TEMPO- trapped products were not detected.
For example , an IMDDA reaction of the all- carbon tether precursor 26 aﬀorded the naphthalene product in 27a quantitative yield , whereas reaction of the tosylamide tether - containing substrate 30 produced the dihydronaphtha- lene 31b in 56 % yield and the naphthalene 31a in 30 % yield when reacted under identical conditions ( entries 1 and 3 , Table 1 ).
As outlined in Scheme 3 , the dianion of 3-methyl-3- butene-1-ol ( 5 ) , generated in tetrahydrofuran with n-butyl lithium and TMEDA , was trapped with 3-bromo-(1-trimethyl- silyl)-1-propyne ( 6 ) to give 7 in 50 % yield.19 The resulting alcohol 7 was protected as a THP ether and treated with tetrabutylammonium ﬂuoride in tetrahydrofuran to aﬀord the terminal alkyne 9.
Alkylation of alkynyl ester 10-OTHP using the methyl Gilman reagent in tetrahydrofuran provided Z-methyl oleﬁn 11-OTHP in excellent yield ( 80 % ).

In addition , DBU also provided 15 in good yield , as described by Inomata .

We hypothesized that this was probably due to the lower basicity of the involved nitrogen atom and / or the iodine counterion which could provide a demethylation reaction.26 To tackle this issue , methyl p-toluenesulfonate was chosen as alkylating agent , and the desired salts 4a ( R3 = Me , R5 = H ) and 4c ( R3 = Me , R5 = Cl ) were isolated in 77 % and 87 % yield , respectively , after puriﬁcation.
A preliminary attempt on 4c was carried out at 70 ° C and furnished a mixture of 2c ( R3 = Me , R4 = Me , R5 = Cl ) and 2d ( R3 = Me , R4 = Et , R5 = Cl ).
amine 4a was ﬁrst reacted with EVE in the presence of Grubbs ’ catalyst G-II under microwave irradiation according to our previous method.12 When the reaction was carried out at 80 ° C in an aqueous solution the desired pyrrole 6a was obtained in 25 − 29 % yield ( entries 1 − 2 ) , while a slightly higher amount ( 36 % , entry 3 ) was isolated when the reaction was run in degassed toluene.
When the reaction was performed under the same conditions and without CuSO4 the pyrrole 6a was not detected and the corresponding diene 5 was recovered in 41 % yield ( entry 5 ).
On the other hand , the use of a stoichiometric amount of CuSO4 led to 6a in only 18 % yield ( entry 6 ).
It is noteworthy that heating the diene intermediate 5 in reﬂuxing toluene led to pyrrole 6a in 24 h , while in the presence of CuSO4 the reaction was completed in 6 h.
The treatment of the tosyl derivative 4b with 10 mol % of G-II led to desired 6b in 53 % yield , while a lower amount of 6b ( 25 % ) was recovered when 5 mol % of catalyst was used ( entry 1 ).
The benzoyl compound 4d aﬀorded the pyrrole 6d in moderate yield ( entry 3 ).

diketoaldehydes D delivers furotropones E in good to excellent yields via cyclization of the dienolates F on to the appropriately positioned aldehyde functionality and subsequent aerobic oxidative aromatization of G.7 This method thus constitutes a general , short , eﬃcient and straightforward approach for the synthesis of cyclohepta[b]furan-6-ones ( commonly referred to as furotropones ).
Reaction of 3o2 and 3p2 under base mediated reaction furnished , surprisingly , 7,8-disubstituted furotropones 3o and 3p , respectively , in good yields , presumably via a retro-Claisen- aromatization sequence as shown in Scheme 3.
After the initial aldol condensation , in order to attain aromaticity , the 7,7,8- trisubstituted cyclohepta[b]furan-6-ones 3o3 and 3p3 undergo base - mediated retro - Claisen cleavage followed by aromatization to form furotropones 3o and 3p , respectively .

presence of a catalytic amount of bismuth(III)chloride , under standard reaction conditions not only furnished the β- ketoesters 3q3 , 3r3 and 3s3 , but subsequently underwent in situ ethoxy decarbonylation , generating mono ( C-8 ) sub- stituted furotropones 3q , 3r and 3s , respectively , in good yields , the reaction can be interrupted Scheme 4.
mediated conditions failed to generate the expected furotro- it yielded a 2,3′-bifuran pone 3t ; however , to our surprise , derivative 4 in 78 % yield in a mechanism described in Scheme 5.
Although the NHC - catalzyed reaction of ketene or α-chloraldehyde with triﬂuoromethyl azadiene gave no or only a trace of the desired cycloadduct , we were encouraged to ﬁnd that the reaction of chloroaldehyde 1a catalyzed by tetracyclic NHC A1′19 gave the desired triﬂuoromethyl dihydropyridinone 3a in 26 % yield with 92 % ee ( entry 1 ).
Further improvements were realized when 4 Å molecular sieves ( 4 Å MS ) was added , giving the desired triﬂuoromethyl dihydropyridinone 3a in 86 % yield with 99 % ee ( entry 13 ).
In our work , the N-Boc azadienes 2 were successfully employed , as expected , and the protective Boc group could be easily removed by TFA in DCM , giving the corresponding dihydropyridinone 4a in 99 % yield without the erosion of enantioselectivity ( eq 1 ) .
The addition of NHC catalyst to chloroaldehyde 1 gives the zwitterionic intermediate I,20 which is converted to the corresponding enolate II by elimination of hydrogen chloride in the presence of base.

In the mechanism for the formation of 3 , hypervalent iodine may activate the double bond as a 3-membered iodonium species , 22,26 which undergoes intra- molecular reaction with the amide nitrogen to form intermediate 23.
Displacement of the hypervalent iodine by the neighboring carbamate may occur by way of an oxazole intermediate 24 , which is opened by iodide to give iodopyrrolizidinone 3 with retention of conﬁguration.
Although the related double bond isomer (Z)-10c ( m = 1 , n = 2 ) underwent iodolactamization to provide iodoindolizidi- none 1 in 86 % yield using I2 in THF at 80 ° C ( Figure 1),8a treatment of unsaturated macrocyclic lactam (Z)-10e ( m = 2 , n = 1 ) under analogous conditions only caused removal of the Dmb group to provide lactam (Z)-11e.
23,24 Dehydroamino acid analogue 20 failed to react using the ﬁrst generation of the Grubbs catalyst , but could be converted to dehydroazepinone 21 with the Grubbs second- generation catalyst ( Scheme 4 ).
25 In spite of the acid sensitivity of the Dmb group , the Boc group could be selectively removed from macrocycle 9g using 50 % TFA in DCM for 2 h to aﬀord the corresponding amine , which was converted to its Fmoc counterpart 10g using Fmoc-OSu and Na2CO3 ( Scheme 3 ).
In one case , a thermo- dynamically less stable 9-membered lactam has been found to give an alternative regio- and stereochemical indolizidinone featuring a 5-membered lactam and a piperidine ring bearing the iodide.37 In addition , 9-membered lactam (Z)-11e gave imidate 5 instead of a fused 7,4-bicycle with the iodide on the 7-membered lactam or a 6,5-bicycle with the iodide on the 5-membered pyrrolidine .
It was also found that decreasing the amounts of 3 and DMF to 0.25 and 1.5 mL ( entry 18 ; concentration of ammonia ≈ 2 M , 1a:2a : 3 molar ratio = 1 : 3 : 7 ) or increasing them to 1 and 6 mL ( entry 19 , concentration of ammonia ≈ 2 M , 1a:2a : 3 molar ratio = 1 : 3 : 28 ) resulted in reduced yields of 5a .
With 1-naphthoaldehyde and thio- phene-2-carboxaldehyde , 4r and 4s were obtained in 68 % and 45 % yield , respectively.
It was found that diversely substituted 1-bromo-2-(2,2-dibromovinyl)- benzenes 1 reacted smoothly with various aryl aldehydes 2 and aqueous ammonia 3 to give a series of 9H-pyrimido[4,5- b]indoles 5 irrespective of the electronic and steric nature of the substituents ( Table 3 , entries 1 − 21 ) .
To our surprise , the reaction of acetaldehyde with 1a and 3 under condition B aﬀorded 2- methyl-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole ( 6a ) rather than the expected 2,4-dimethyl-9H-pyrimido[4,5-b]indole.
In the next stage , condensation of V with 2a gives imine VI.
Article ( condition B ) , III ﬁrst undergoes an intramolecular C − N coupling to give 2-bromoindole ( IX ) , which then undergoes an aryl amination to give 2-aminoindole ( X ).
Nucleophilic addition of X onto imine XI , formed in situ from the condensation of 2a with 3 , aﬀords XII.
Subsequent condensation of XII with 2a gives imine XIII , and then nucleophilic cyclization of XIII occurs to aﬀord tetrahydro-1H- pyrimido[4,5-b]indole ( XIV ).
Finally , oxidative aromatization of XIV gives 5a as the ﬁnal product ( Scheme 3 ) .
As for the formation of 6a , it should start with the reaction of 1a with 3 under condition B to give intermediates III , IX , and X sequentially.
Michael addition of X toward XV aﬀords the adduct XVI , which then undergoes an intramolecular aldol - type reaction to sequentially give XVII and XVIII.
Finally , oxidative dehydro- genation of XVIII aﬀords 6a ( Scheme 4 ).
Second , III was treated with 2a and 3 under condition B to give 5a in 68 % yield ( Scheme 6 ).
Third , IX was treated with 2a and 3 under condition B to give 5a in a yield of 80 % ( Scheme 7 ).

When this PFAA was mixed with thioacetic acid in methanol at 25 ° C in the presence of 1.3 equiv of 2,6-lutidine for 15 min , amide 3 ( 74 % ) together with a small amount of aniline 4 ( 7 % ) was observed by 19F NMR ( entry 1 , Table 1 ).
When 2,6-lutidine was absent , aniline 4 was formed as the major product ( entry 2 ) , likely the result of reduction of the PFAA by thioacetic acid .
If thioacetic acid was ﬁrst treated with TBAOH and the isolated TBA - thioacetate salt ( 5 ) was added to PFAA 1 , amide product 3 was obtained in quantitative yield without any aniline byproduct ( Scheme 2 ).
As shown in Table 3 , the reactions in water ( entry 1 ) or in pH 7.4 buﬀer ( entry 3 ) were completed within 2 h to give amide 7 in > 90 % yield.

The Suzuki − Miyaura coupling of a 2-bromo- aniline ( 1a − c ) and a 3-dialkylaminophenylboronic acid ( 2a − c ) furnished a biphenyl ( 3a − e ) , catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)4 diazotization of which with NaNO2 in acidic aqueous medium at 0 ° C generated the corresponding benzo[c]cinnoline derivative ( 4a − e ).
Thus , 5-arylidenehydantoin derivatives 1 − 5 were synthesized from the condensation of hydantoin and diﬀerent aromatic aldehydes in an acetic acid / ammonium acetate mixture in good yields ( 70 − 80 % , see Supporting Information for synthetic details ) according to a previously reported method.48 The disubstituted 1,3-dimethyl-5-arylide- nehydantoins 6 − 11 were obtained in two diﬀerent ways.
Thus , treatment of glyoxal with N , N′-dimethylurea followed by pinacol rearrange- ment delivered the clean formation of 1,3-dimethylhydantoin.
The β-iodo-α-amino acid derivatives 9a and 9b were easily prepared from L-serine 6 by ring - opening of the corresponding oxazoline derivatives 8a ( or 8b ) with trimethylsilyl iodide.15b Alternatively , the synthesis of the allyl and benzyl γ-iodo-α-amino esters 9c,d was achieved by starting from the L-aspartic acid 7 via the formation of the N,N-diBoc- homoserine intermediates 11c,d ( Scheme 1 ).
Thus , the phosphonium salt allyl ester 4a was obtained in 55 % isolated yield by heating the o-(pinacolato)boronatophenyl phosphine 10 with the β-iodo-α-amino ester 9a in toluene at 60 ° C overnight ( Scheme 1a ; Table 1 , entry 1 ).
The o- boronatophenylphosphine 10 also reacts with the β-iodo-α- amino acid 9b by heating in acetonitrile to directly aﬀord the corresponding phosphonium salt 4b bearing a free carboxylic acid function in 70 % yield ( entry 2 ).
Under alternate conditions , when heated in toluene at 76 ° C for 6 h , the γ- iodo-α-amino esters 9c and 9d react with 10 to aﬀord the phosphonium amino esters 4c and 4d in 88 and 80 % chemical yields , respectively ( Scheme 1b ; Table 1 , entries 3 and 4 ).
After 6 h in acetonitrile at 50 ° C , the corresponding dipeptide 13 was obtained in 61 % yield.
The ﬂuorination reaction of the compound 13 was then achieved in 30 min by reaction KHF2 to aﬀord the triﬂuoroborato − phosphonium dipeptide 14 in 78 % yield ( Scheme 3 ).
The saponiﬁcation of the boronato − phosphonium amino esters 4c or 4d leads to the compound 4e with a free carboxylic acid in 88 % yield , while HCl acidolysis then treatment with DABCO aﬀords the amino derivative 4g in 69 % overall yield.
The eﬀectiveness of the boronato − phosphonium derivatives 4 in peptide coupling was demonstrated by reaction of the amino derivative 4g with the benzyl-β-pentaﬂuorophenate L-aspartate 12 , leading to the corresponding dipeptide 13 in 61 % yield.
In addition , the reaction of the boronato − phosphonium amino acid and peptide derivatives 4a − f and 13 with ﬂuoride cleanly aﬀords the corresponding triﬂuoroborates 5a − f and 14 in approximately 1 h in isolated yields up to 90 % , without signiﬁcant degradation by hydrolysis in a phosphate buﬀer pH 7.
Heterocyclic disulﬁde 2g also proves to be a suitable reaction partner for this reaction , providing thioether 3g with high yield.
Under identical reaction conditions , very little desired thioether ( 3w ) is detected via LC / MS when using 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoqui- none ( 1b ) and benzyl disulﬁde ( 2m ) as the starting materials ( Scheme 4 ).
Adding an electron - donating group at the 3-position of 1,4-naphtho- quinone ( 1a ) , such as an alkyl substituent , aﬀords the thioether ( 3m ) with improved yield.
Initially , silver complex [Ag(I)(dppp)]OAc ( 5 ) interacting with phenyl disulﬁde ( 2a ) forms the active intermediate 6a , which then generates silver thiolate 7 and sulphenyl acetate 8.19 The reaction of silver thiolate 7 with 1,4- naphthoquinone ( 1a ) forms complex 9 , and it was then oxidized by sulphenyl acetate 8 to aﬀord the desired thioether 3a.
At the same time , sulphenyl acetate 8 is reduced to thiophenol 10 with the regeneration of silver complex 5 , and the thiophenol 10 is oxidized back to phenyl disulﬁde ( 2a ) by (NH4)2S2O8 / DMSO for next reaction circle.17
Therefore , more ClPhS− ( 12 ) is generated to react with 1,4-naphthoqui- none ( 1a ) , yielding more thioether 3d.

After workup , spirocyclic compound 6a was obtained as a single axial hydroxy isomer in 81 % yield.
For instance , p-bromo benzaldehyde gave 6b and 6g in excellent yields ( Table 2 , entries 2 and 7 ).
Interestingly , benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal underwent smooth spiro cyclization in the presence of TMSOTf in dichloromethane at 0 ° C to room temperature aﬀording desired product 6j in 88 % yield ( Table 2 entry 10 ).
In 1971 , Ogata and Urasaki reported the conversion of diphenylacetylene ( 1a ) to (E)-2-iodo-1,2-diphenylvinyl acetate ( 2a ) following the in situ generation of iodine monoacetate ( IOAc ) from a combination of per-acetic acid and iodine in acetic acid.5,6 Subsequently , the Barluenga research group reported a similar cohalogenation of alkynes ·BF4 and an appropriate nucleophile in the using I(Py)2 presence of tetraﬂuoroboric acid.7 In 1999 , Togo and co- workers described the iodo-tosyloxylation of various internal
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Initially , the conditions reported by Yanada using acetic acid and NIS in 1,2-dichloroethane ( DCE ) at 40 ° C were trialed for the functionalization of diphenylacetylene ( 1a ) but failed to aﬀord the desired product 2a ( Table 1 , entry 1 ).
The reaction using silver acetate and iodine in DCE provided 2a in modest yield ( 58 % , entry 2 ) with a signiﬁcant amount of benzil ( 3 ) also identiﬁed from over oxidation.
The use of iodobenzene diacetate and iodine to generate the reactive iodine monoacetate led to the formation of 2a in excellent yield of 82 % with the trans-isomer formed as the major product ( Table 1 , entry 3 ).
the inclusion of 4Å molecular sieves suppressed the side reaction , the oxidation of diphenylacetylene to 3 ( entry 5 ).
For the iodoacetoxylation of the ynamide derivative 4a , at elevated temperatures the thermodynamic pathway was favored leading to formation of a higher portion of the cis-isomer 5a′ ; however , at 0 ° C the kinetic pathway predominates to aﬀord almost exclusively the trans-isomer 5a.
To further probe the eﬀect of temperature on this reaction process , the iodoacetox- ylation of 1c was performed at elevated temperature ( 60 ° C ) in an attempt to generate the cis-adduct ; however , once again the trans-isomer of 2c was formed as the major product ( 83 % yield , E / Z = 40 : 1 ).
The iodoacetoxylation of 1f was then conducted at − 20 ° C to observe if the kinetic pathway to form the trans- isomer could be favored ; however , the cis-isomer of 2f was again isolated as the major product ( 86 % yield , E / Z = 1 : 12 ).
To further highlight the value of the products obtained using the method described herein , vinyl iodide 2a was subjected to Suzuki cross-coupling with 3,5-dimethylphenyl boronic acid to aﬀord tetrasubstituted alkene 6 which was subsequently
For example , using 1a and 2a as coupling partners gave the desired vicinal diamine 3a in 80 % yield with 10 : 1 dr after quenching with 1 N HCl ( Scheme 2 ; only the major diamine diastereomer is shown in eq 1 ).
Overwhelming desilylation was also observed when KHMDS and 2a were added stepwise to the THF solution of 1a , which failed to give any 1,2-diamine 3a ( eq 2 ).
To conﬁrm that migration actually occurred , we quenched the reaction with aqueous NaHCO3 rather than 1 N HCl solution and obtained the N-silyl diamine 4a ( eq 1 ).
Coupling 1a and 2a in the presence of CsF was examined,40 and predominantly benzylamine 5 formed ; the coupling product 3a was obtained in low yield ( 24 % ) with poor diastereocontrol ( 1.2 : 1 dr ) showing syn selectivity ( eq 4 ).
The α-silylamines 1a − l were prepared by nucleophilic addition of PhMe2Si− MgiPr·LiCl or PhMe2Si − Bpin ( pin = pinacolato ) to the corresponding aryl aldimines45−51 and then used in the coupling protocol to aﬀord aryl vicinal diamines in 58 − 93 % yield with diastereoselectivities ranging from 6 : 1 to > 20 : 1 ( entries 13 − 23 ).
this process , the anti-1,2-diamine 3x was prepared in 85 % yield by combining N-PMP α-silylamine 1m and N-DPP imine 2c in the presence of KHMDS ( Scheme 3 ).
The coupling product 3x was converted to the corresponding imidazolidinone 6 in order to remove the nitrogen-protecting groups.53 Then 6 was treated with NaOMe to remove the DPP group and with CAN ( cerium ammonium nitrate ) to remove the PMP group.
Finally , acidic hydrolysis ( HBr / HOAc ) produced the free diamine 7 .
The reaction was complete in 4 h , relative to the 12 h typically reported for other stereoselective methods.19,20 A gram - scale reaction was performed with thioanisole , using 1 mol % of the rhodium catalyst and aﬀording the desired sulﬁlimine 3 in 88 % yield and 94 : 6 dr.
The resulting sulﬁlimine 28 was recrystallized , and a single diastereomer was isolated in 34 % .
Whereas no conversion was observed with peroxide reagent , sodium hypochlorite or sodium perborate ( entries 1 − 6 ) , the use of an excess of m-CPBA in ethanol aﬀorded 83 % of desired sulfoximine 29 without any traceable racemization ( entry 7 ).
Better yields and faster reactions were observed with ruthenium - catalyzed oxidation in the presence of sodium periodate ; 98 % of the desired sulfoximine 29 was isolated , again without any detectable racemization ( entry 9 ) .
Methionine sulfoximine was the very ﬁrst isolated and fully characterized sulfoximine.28 Several biological studies have established the physiological properties of methionine sulfoximine.4e The oxidation of methonine - derived sulﬁlimine 28 aﬀorded the corresponding protected sulfoximine 33 in high yield and as a single diastereomer ( Scheme 4 ).
Orthogonal cleavage of the phenyl- Troc protecting group ( (O)COCH(Ph)CCl3 ) was achieved with zinc in acetic acid , producing methionine NH - sulfoximine 34 in a good yield as a single diastereomer.
The best chiral discrimination was observed with cyclo- hexylmethyl thioether , producing sulﬁlimine 26 in 92 % yield
In the absence of an additive , in isopropyl acetate , sulﬁlimine 3 was isolated in 85 % yield and 75 : 25 dr ( Table 3 , entry 1 ).
Conversely , Rh2(cap)4 ( E1 / 2 = 11 mV , quasi-reversible ) produced sulﬁlimine 3 in good yields , albeit with no selectivity ( entry 3 ).
Interestingly , the use of a mixture of Rh2(cap)4 and NBS , previously reported to produce the corresponding Rh(II)−Rh(III) complex,36 af- forded the same yield of sulﬁlimine 3 ( entry 4 ).
These base , experiments strongly suggested the formation of sulfonyloxcar- bamate anion B , which could coordinate with the rhodium catalyst ( presumably a DMAP - bound Rh(II)−Rh(III) species ) to form species C ( Scheme 6 ).
41 The addition of the thioether then displaced the sulfonate anion to form species E , which then fragmented to release the sulﬁlimine and the catalyst.
Aside from the construction of heterocycles , this protocol oﬀers a route to bulky ketone imines , which are useful building blocks and diﬃcult to access.7 We treated 4b with LiAlH4 in THF at 60 ° C and obtained amine 5 in nearly quantitative yield ( Scheme 3 ) .
Wittig - type chemistry or alternative reduction methodology of propargylic alcohols should give a stereoselective access to the allylic alcohols C and D which then can undergo enantioselective epoxidation to give the chiral epoxides E , F , G , and H , respectively .
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2-Chromanone 6 is reduced in the presence of DIBAL-H to obtain the desired lactol 7 in high chemical yield ( Scheme 3 ).
17 Reaction of 7 with carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine provides geminal dibromide 8 , and subsequent addition of n- butyllithium in the presence of paraformaldehyde aﬀords propargyl alcohol 9 in high chemical yield.
transformed into tosylate 12 followed by base - induced epoxide formation in the presence of sodium methoxide to give 13.
The desired inverted secondary alcohols 18 and 22 are then generated by saponiﬁcation of the obtained PNBA esters 17 and 21 without loss of enantiomeric purity.
We have found that the reaction of BQ derivatives 1 and allylboronates 2 in a 2 : 1 ratio ( method A ) results in allyl-BQs 3 in high yield and in most cases with high selectivity ( Scheme 1 ).
In the case of 2,5-disubstituted quinones ( R4 ≠ H ) , the addition product ( 3′ ) was formed by mixing equimolar amounts of the reaction components ( Scheme 1 ) .
Benzoquinone 1a ( BQ ) reacted readily with cinnamylboro- nate 2a to give BQ - derivative 3a with high yield and excellent regio- and stereoselectivity ( Table 1 ).
Using alkyl-Bpin substrate 2b the reaction with BQ ( 1a ) led to 3b ( entry 2 ) , but the reaction was slower than with cinnamyl boronate 2a.
Farnesyl-Bpin 2c also reacted easily with 1a to give natural product , farnesyl-BQ 3c.
Naphthoquinone 1b can be simply isoprenylated with 2d to obtain 3d .
For example , hemitectol23 7 can be synthesized in only three steps from naphthoquinone 1b and allyl alcohol based isoprenyl-Bpin 2d followed by biomimetic 6π-electrocyclization8c in pyridine ( Scheme 4 ).
A naphthyl oxocarboxylic acid also eﬃciently reacted with cinnamic acid , giving the product 16 in 64 % yield.
Interestingly , aliphatic α-keto acids also underwent the decarboxylation to give the corresponding products 19 and 20 in 52 % and 38 % yield , respectively.
Reaction of 1.5 g ( 10 mmol ) of benzoylformic acid with 2.0 equiv cinnamic acid ( 2a ) under the standard reaction conditions generated 1 ( 1.29 g ) in 62 % yield ( Scheme 3 ) .
First , when the radical scavenger 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy ( TEMPO ) was added to the reaction mixture , only a trace amount of 1 was observed by GC-MS ( Scheme 4a ) , whereas in the presence of hydroquinone the reaction was completely inhibited and the corresponding radical adducts were detected by GC-MS ( Scheme 4b ; for details , see the Supporting Information ).
Using FeCl2 as the catalyst precursor , the reaction provided the desired product 2 in 81 % yield.
The reaction using FeCl3 as the catalyst precursor aﬀorded a 77 % yield of 2.
The isobutyl-substituted derivative 8e is apparently completely converted to the expected diazonium salt 9e in the deacetylation − diazotation sequence , as indicated by TLC , but it does not precipitate under any combination of reaction parameters ( entry 7 ).
With 19a′ in methanol , the expected biphenyl 20aa was formed together with a considerable amount of methyl ether 21 , which was identiﬁed by comparison of its spectroscopic data with those reported previously in the literature.78 The formation of this solvolysis product was fully suppressed when the analogous potassium organotriﬂuoroborate 19a was used.
Performing the coupling of 9a and 19a in dioxane instead of methanol worked equally well and gave 20aa in comparable selectivity .
conﬁrmation of formation of intermediate 13a′ , we performed the reaction with N-Me substituent 13h under our optimized condition and we were able to separate 15,13 which on treatment with CuI at reﬂuxing DMF aﬀorded the sultam 1613 in 90 % yield ( Scheme 4 ).
From this observation it is quite sure that reaction of 13a to 14aa must be gone through the intermediate 13a′ .
For the ortho derivative , (4-bromophenyl)boronic acid ( 5 ) was prepared ﬁrst , in the Suzuki coupling with 2-bromopyridine aﬀorded 2-(4-bromophenyl)pyridine (6)44,45 in a yield of 29 % .
The subsequent Suzuki reaction with the pyrrole boronic acid,46 according to the optimized conditions for the arylation of pyrrole47 and the Boc-deprotection in basic conditions ( Scheme 1 ) , gave the target compound 2.48
Synthesis of meta derivative 3 started from the commercially available 3-pyridineboronic acid that was arylated in a Suzuki coupling to aﬀord bromide 749,50 and subsequently reacted in another Suzuki coupling with pyrroleboronic acid to give 3-Boc derivative.
The reaction gave the 1,2- ( minor ) and 1,4-adducts ( major ) which were isolated as a mixture and without characterization treated with a base to aﬀord 848 as the major product , isolated in the overall yield of 25 % .
We were pleased to ﬁnd that the optimized reaction conditions used for indole substrates also worked well for oxindole 6a and produced the spirooxindole 7a in 83 % yield , although requiring a signiﬁcantly longer reaction time ( Table 1 , entry 1 ).
Interestingly , when EtOH was used as the solvent , only the compound 2-(1-ethoxy-3- phenylprop-2-yn-1-yl)phenol was isolated in 92 % yield ( Table 1 , entry 15 ).
As expected , the desired product 2-(3-oxo-1-phenylbutyl)phenyl acetate was obtained in 80 % yield .
corresponding alcohol 8 , azide 9 was obtained after activation of the alcohol via the corresponding mesyl ester.
Staudiger reaction followed by coupling with isothiocyanate 10 provided cis-ﬂuoro derivative 11.
cis-Hydroxyproline 12 was synthesized from 6.
The product 28 was obtained in almost quantitative yield and 70 % ee.
ABSTRACT : Tetrahydro[60]fullerene epoxides C60(O)- Arn(NR2)4−n , n = 1 , 2 , have been prepared by treating 1,4- adducts C60(OH)Ph and C60(Tol)2 with cyclic secondary amines.
For example , the reaction of piperidine with 2 aﬀorded 5a and 6a , which are analogous to the 4-methylpiperidine products 5 and 6.
Treatment of 6 with ferric chloride in toluene aﬀorded the hexaadduct 7 with the addition of another tolyl addend.15b,17 Hydroxyl and alkoxyl groups were added by using p- toluenesulfonic acid as the catalyst.
The epoxide opening reactions are highly regioselective , producing only the product with the hydroxyl group on the central pentagon.11 The vicinal diol moiety in 8a can be easily converted to the open - cage diketone 9 with diacetoxyliodobenzene.18 The 10-membered oriﬁce in 9 could be closed to form isomers 10a and 10b by treating it with methanol in the presence of BF3.
hydroxyl group on the central pentagon.19 The epoxy moiety in compounds 3 , 4 , and 5 could also be hydrolyzed to the vicinal diols 11 , 12 , and 13 , and then oxidized into the corresponding open - cage diketone compounds 14 , 15 , and 16 , respectively ( Figure 2 ).
in ODEs ( 1 ) participates in an Ullmann coupling reaction with 3-(2-bromoaryl)-1H-pyrazoles ( 2 ) providing benzo[e]pyrazolo- [1,5-c][1,3] thiazines ( 3 ).
In mode B , the coupling reactions occur in the methylene of ODEs ( 1 ) , providing pyrazolo[5,1- a]isoquinolines ( 3′ ) through a Hurtley coupling reaction.26c Under our reaction conditions only 3 were obtained exclusively , and 3′ were not observed , which suggested that our protocol shows high chemoselectivity .
But after addition of CuI ( 0.1 equiv ) , the product 3a was obtained in a yield of 25 % ( Table 1 , entry 2 ).
Initially a reaction between substrate β-oxodithioest- ers 1 and CuI would occur to give complex I , which undergoes an oxidative addition reaction with 2 to yield Cu(III) intermediate A.
Mechanistically , the reaction proceeds via initial oxidation of naphthalene to o-quinone , which undergoes cleavage to the corresponding o-carboxyarylacrylic acid.
In continuation of our ongoing research on IBX- and Oxone ·K2SO4 ) - mediated oxidation chemistry,7b,16 ( 2KHSO5 we recently showed that naphthalene undergoes oxidation with Oxone , providing o-carboxycinnamic acid and naphthoquinone in 56 and 31 % yields , respectively.7b This spurred us to comprehensively investigate oxidations of methoxy- and hydroxy-substituted naphthalenes with Oxone in view of environmentally benign , nontoxic , cheap , and easy handling attributes of the latter.
Oxidation of 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene led to caboxy- lactone in 50 % yield over a period of 14 h ; 2,3-dihydroxy-1,4- naphthoquindione was isolated in 15 % yield ( entry 13 ).
Oxidation of anthracene has been shown in our earlier investigation to lead to anthraquinone and bianthronyl.7b In phenantherenes , the C9 - C10 bond is highly susceptible to oxidation.
The reaction of phenanthrene with Oxone in CH3CN − H2O ( 1 : 1 mixture ) at reﬂux led to diphenic acid and 3,4,5,6-dibenzo-α-pyranone , derived from a cascade oxidation , Dakin reaction,19 hydrolysis , and lactonization , in 59 and 23 % isolated yields ( cf.
Oxidation of the latter led to diphenic acid in 85 % yield in 18 h , while the hydroxy-analogue reacted much faster yielding the same product in 12 h ( Table 2 , entries 6 and 5 ).
The synthesis was started with the construction of building blocks 2 and 3 from iodobenzene 5 , which was prepared through an established method.12 After unsuccessful attempts to methylate 5 with dimethyl sulfate , it was then methylated with iodomethane in a to give dimethyl ether 6 in excellent yield.
sealed vessel Iodobenzenes 5 and 6 then underwent Sonogashira coupling with propargyl alcohol to give alcohols 7 and 8 , which were hydrogenated to give building blocks 2 and 3 with good yields in two steps , respectively.
After transforming the hydroxyl group of 3 into a bromine with PBr3 , bromide 9 was then reacted with building block 2 in the presence of K2CO3 and 18-crown-6 to form two ether bonds simultaneously without protecting its less acidic hydroxyl group , providing ﬁrst - generation dendron 10 in a 72 % yield over sequential bromination with PBr3 and Williamson ether synthesis with
Bromination of dendron 14 followed by Williamson ether synthesis with 4 , 4′,4″-(ethane-1,1,1-triyl)- triphenol 4 provided dendrimer 1 on a gram scale.
Using quinine - derived thiourea I , product 3a was obtained with high enantioselectivity ( 98 % ee ) but moderate diastereoselec- tivity ( 5 : 1 dr ) ( entry 1 ).
However , the use of cinchonine- derived thiourea II provided product 3a with poor diastereo-
16 Notably , the ketimine without the substituted group at the 1-position could also react well with α- methyl-substituted MTM to aﬀord Mannich product 3c in 92 % yield with 16 : 1 dr and 98 % ee.
MTM with a p-chlorophenyl thioester also worked well to provide product 3o in 90 % yield with > 20 : 1 dr and 98 % ee .
So , the previously reported alcohol 9,9 obtained from diol 8 in four steps including ones involving Negishi cross-coupling and intramolecular Diels − Alder cycloaddition reactions,10 was into acetate 10 and its converted , by conventional means , structure conﬁrmed by single - crystal X-ray analysis.11 Com- pound 10 could be diastereoselectively cis-dihydroxylated using the Sharpless modiﬁcation of the Upjohn conditions12 and so aﬀording the diol 11 and this then converted into the corresponding p-methoxyphenylbenzylidene acetal through its reaction with p-methoxybenzaldehyde dimethylacetal ( PMBDMA ) in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid ( p- TsOH ).
So , hydrolysis of the acetonide residue associated with compound 15 aﬀorded the diol 16 that could be selectively mono-oxidized using the sterically demanding oxammonium salt derived from the p-TsOH - promoted disproportionation of 4-acetamido- TEMPO17 and thereby generating the bis-acyloin 17.
The structure of this last compound was also conﬁrmed by single- crystal X-ray analysis.11 Benzoylation of compound 17 then gave triester 18 , which upon reaction with samarium iodide in THF / methanol at − 78 ° C aﬀorded the C4 / C8-dideoxygenated compound 1918 embodying an “ isolated ” C7-carbonyl unit as encountered in natural products 1 and 2 .
So when compound 13 was treated with this reagent ( Scheme 3 ) , then the lactol 20 was obtained as a single diastereoisomer
Gratifyingly , the desired coumarin 2a was obtained as the major product in 60 % yield.
The radical A adds to alkynoates 1 to produce the radical intermediate B , which undergoes intramolecular homolytic aromatic substitu- tion to give the radical intermediate C.
The intermediate C is then oxidized by [fac-Ir(IV)(ppy)3]+ to form the cyclo- hexadienyl cation D and regenerates [fac-Ir(III)(ppy)3].
Finally , with 6.0 equiv of MnO2 and a prolonged reaction period ( 90 min ) , we obtained 2a in 61 % GC yield ( entry 8 ).
10 For phenyl- methanesulfonyl chloride ( 1b ) with a weakly electron-with- drawing α-phenyl group , the reaction produced exclusively [2s+2i] annuladducts cis- and trans-β-sultams 3ba diastereose- lectively , with cis-isomer in 39 % yield and trans-isomer in 29 % ( Table 1 , entry 5 ).
The sulfonyl chloride 1c with a strongly electron - withdrawing α-ethoxycarbonyl group readily reacted with imine 2a to give rise to trans-β-sultam 3a stereospeciﬁcally together with [2s+2i+2i] annuladduct ethyl in 59 % yield , rel(3S,5S,6R)-2,4-dimethyl-3,5-diphenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazinane-6-
[2s+2i+2i] annuladducts 6a and 6b were obtained in 20 % and 26 % isolated yields , respectively , without [2s+2i] annuladduct detected by the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude reaction mixture.
Subsequent studies on the eﬀect of the 1c:2a ratios on the annuloselectivity showed that when 1c:2a equals 1 : 3 , the the [2s+2i] annuladduct 3a decreased and the fraction of [2s+2i+2i] annuladduct was obtained in the highest 16 % yield ( Table 2 , entry 1 , Table 3 , entries 1 and 2 ).
When compound 6b was treated with 3 equiv of imine 5 at room temperature for 48 h , it was smoothly converted into thermodynamically stable (3,5)-cis- (5,6)-trans-annuladduct 6a , with a 40 : 60 ratio of 6a:6b , approximating to the ratio 44 : 56 obtained from the reaction mixture.
Thus , it predominantly attacks the intermediate D to give E and F , which subsequently undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic addition to give rise to the [2s+2i+2i] annuladducts 6 exclusively ( Scheme 6 ).
The generated intermediate D exclusively undergoes a Mannich - type nucleophilic addition of another molecule of imine 5 ( intermolecularly nucleophilic addition ) to form intermediate E , which further undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic addition to produce [2s+2i+2i] annuladduct 6a.
Next , we hydrolyzed the diastereoisomerically pure complex (S,S)-3a under acidic conditions and obtained(S)-phenylglycine (S)-4a in 90 % yield and > 99 % ee ( Scheme 2 ).
Reaction of the known thiazole 410 with a 2-fold molar excess11 of organolithium species 58 aﬀorded 2 in 74 % yield.
Crude 11 thus obtained was immediately oxidized to 3 ( MnO2 ) , a delicate substance ( oil ) which was partially puriﬁed by rapid elution through deactivated ( Et3N ) silica gel , in order to contain losses to an acceptable level.17
The Hantzsch - type conditions developed earlier7,8 for the assembly of pyridines lacking the 3-OH functionality proved to be inadequate for the conversion of 12 into 13.
However , pyridine 13 emerged in 28 % yield from 2 and 3 over 2 steps , after chromatography , upon slow addition ( 3 h , syringe pump ) of a solution of crude 12 in a 4 : 1 mixture of 2,2,2- triﬂuoroethanol and acetic acid into a solution of NH4OAc ( 12.5 equiv ) and PPTS18 ( 1 equiv ) in the same solvent system , maintained 60 ° C under an O2 atmosphere ( balloon ) , followed by stirring for 14 h at 60 ° C.
To our delight , the desired spirocyclic product 3d could be obtained in 19 % yield .
With substrates 1d − h , which contain electron - rich groups such as tert-butyl , methoxy , methyl , isopropyl , and cyclohexyl at the 4-position of the phenolic ring , the envisioned spirocyclic enones 3d − h were obtained in 55 − 71 % yields.
Noteworthy , the substrate with an ortho- substituent ( ﬂuoro ) ( 1w ) , which was totally inactive studies,8,12 could undergo the desired in the previous spiroannulation to give compound 3w in 44 % yield .
The key step should be the unique enol - keto tautomerization of phenolic ring in 6 to provide a dearomatized intermediate 7 , which is the less strained tautomer.
Finally , a C − C bond - forming reductive elimination of the ring contracted ruthenacycle 7 delivers the spirocyclic product 3 and Ru0 , which can be reoxidized by Cu(OAc)2 to regenerate Ru(II) for the next catalytic cycle .
Fortunately , replacement of the base with an excess the nucleophile aﬀorded product (R)-5a in high yield of without any racemization.
The aldehyde then reacted with another equivivalent of propylamine to form the imine , which was attacked by cyanide to give compound 6 ( Scheme 4 ).
reduction was achieved by catalytic hydrogenation using Raney nickel as catalyst and with 20 bar of H2 reduction of enantioenriched O-acetylated (S)-mandelonitrile at 120 ° C has been shown to result in partial racemization ( from 95 % to 75 % ee),11 our modiﬁed conditions gave the desired products (R)-7a − b with practically no racemization , albeit in low yields ( Scheme 5 ).
However , attempts to perform the catalytic hydro- genation of 4 only led to reduction of the bromide to yield O- acetylated mandelonitrile .
The synthesis started with the minor enantiomer recycling with 3- chlorobenzaldehyde and acyl cyanide 8 , prepared from CuCN and bromoacetyl bromide ( Scheme 6 ).
Two - step hydrolysis of compound 7aa gave the amino acid 9a.
Rh - catalyzed insertion reactions of 8 with ethyl diazoacetate and trimethylsilyl diazomethane provided products 9 and 10 in 36 % and 15 % yields , respectively , after puriﬁcation by ﬂash chromatography.
Two compounds with B − S bonds were also made by reaction of 8 with the corresponding benzothiazole 2-thiol or N- phenyltetrazole disulﬁde.14 Heating of 8 and benzothiazole 2- thiol ( BtSH ) in benzene at 80 ° C , followed by evaporation and automated ﬂash chromatography , gave boryl sulﬁde 11 in 58 % yield.
In the reaction between 8 and N-phenyltetrazole disulﬁde ( PtSSPt ) , the corresponding boryl sulﬁde 12 formed at room temperature in 59 % isolated yield.
The use of CsF as ﬂuoride source and acetonitrile as solvent at 30 ° C turned out to be the best conditions , aﬀording the desired product 3aa in 64 % yield ( Table 1 ).
Two aryl moieties seem to be crucial for a successful reaction since cyclopropenones with one or two aliphatic moieties , such as methylphenylcyclopropenone or bis(tert- butyl)cyclopropenone , showed no conversion to 3al and 3am , irrespective of varying reaction times and temperatures , despite full consumption of the starting materials.
The required chalcone derivative 9 was synthesized from commercially available acetophenone derivative 11 in 4 steps.
Thus , 11 was converted to α,β unsaturated ketone derivative 12 in 3 steps by a known protocol,8 followed by reduction of the double bond of 12 by 5 % Pd / C , under a hydrogen atmosphere to aﬀord the required dihydrochalcone 9 in 96 % yield ( Scheme 2 ).
The piperetol ( 10 ) was obtained by reduction of the keto group of (−)-piperitone using Luche reduction.9 With required fragments in hand , the stage was set to investigate the key Friedel − Crafts coupling reaction.
Thus , the reaction of dihydrochalcone derivative 9 with alcohol 10 in the presence of 30 mol % p-TSA in reﬂuxing toluene furnished (+)-hostmanin A ( 7 ) as a single diastereomer with 79 % yield , whose spectral data ( 1H , 13C , IR , and HRMS ) and optical rotation { [α]D + 59.4 ( c 0.15 , MeOH ) } were identical to those reported for the natural product4 ( Scheme 3 ).
Treatment of DMDO with (+)-methyllin- dratin ( 5 ) directly generated the advanced tricyclic intermediate 13 in 79 % yield and > 20 : 1 diastereomeric ratio ( determined by crude 1H NMR ) by epoxidation of the double bond , followed by opening of epoxide 14 by the adjacent phenolic-OH group , as shown in Scheme 4.
Conversion of tricyclic intermediate 13 to linderol A ( 6 ) required the formation of a double bond at the benzylic position.
Thus , enantioselective total synthesis of compound 13 under Saegusa − Ito oxidation condition10 gave (−)-linderol A ( 6 ) in 77 % yield.
The ﬁrst synthesis of ATPF has been carried out by coupling of ADP and ﬂuorophosphate tributylammonium salts using the Michelson method ( diphe- nylchlorophosphate in pyridine ) and isolated in about 35 % yield after quite complex chemoenzymatic workup.5a GTPF has been synthesized directly from GTP by treatment with isolated only in 5 − 10 % yield,5d dinitroﬂuorobenzene , but whereas ADPF has been synthesized in 25 % yield by reacting adenosine 5′-phosphomorpholidate and ﬂuoromonophosphate in pyridine.6a,8 Notably , all the reported procedures gave moderate to low yields and have been demonstrated only on a single target molecule.
As monitored by RP HPLC combined with MS(−)ES analysis of the UV - absorbing peaks ( Figure 2 ) , adenosine phosphorimidazolide ( 2a ; tR = 12 min ) treated with 6 equiv of TBAF in DMSO at rt and in the presence of 8 equiv of ZnCl2 was nearly quantitatively converted into AMPF ( 3a ; tR = 10.8 min , m / z = 348 ) within 2 h ( the reaction could be accelerated by addition of a higher excess of TBAF ).
For compound 2h ( tR 6.5 min , Figure 2B ) the conversion into corresponding ﬂuoromethylenebisphosphonate ( 3h , tR 5.0 min ) was nearly quantitative , and due to the high −P bond no ﬂuoride - mediated chemical cleavage was observed even in the presence of high TBAF concentrations.
However , reaction with TBAF was prolonged or a higher excess of TBAF was used , 3j was eﬃciently cleaved by ﬂuoride producing two diastereomers of AMBH3F ( 3k ) as major products ( Table 1 , entries 10 and 11 ; Figure S2 in the Supporting Information ).
Imidodiphosphate derivative 2k was also converted into the corresponding ﬂuoroimidodiphosphate ( 3l ) , however , the reaction was notably slower , taking over 24 h and reaching only 65 % HPLC conversion ( Figure 2C ).
19 For comparison , we also determined the KD value for the complex between DcpS and an unhydrolyzable analogue of 3t , m7GpNHpF ( 3ad ) , which was synthesized by treating GpNHpF ( 3l ) with CH3I in DMSO.
The resulting inter- mediate oxonium ion 38 , however , would develop a signiﬁcant fraction of the ring strain inherent in the trans-bicyclo[3.3.0]- octane system ( > 15 kcal / mol ).
The nitrone 1 prepared from D-xylose42 reacted with allyl Grignard reagent to aﬀord only a single diastereomer 2 ( dr > 95 ).
The high trans-selectivity is in accord with previous reports.43−46 Oxidation of hydroxylamine 2 with activated 47,48 gave two separable regioisomers 3 and 4.
The MnO2 cycloadduct 5 was obtained as the only product in high yield
Catalytic hydrogenolysis ( 10 % Pd / C ) in acidic methanol furnished the iminosugar 6 in high yield.
The synthesis of 16 commenced with a stereoselective nucleophilic addition of Grignard reagent to nitrone 1 to aﬀord the hydroxylamine 11 in high yield ( Scheme 3 ) ; 11 was oxidized with activated MnO2 directly without isolation.
After conversion of the acetal 12 to aldehyde 14 , the intramolecular 31,32,49,50 was reductive coupling reaction promoted by SmI2 attempted ; hydroxylamine 15 was obtained as the single diastereomer.
Reduction of followed by oxidation by activated MnO2 , gave the key nitrone 21.
After oxidation of the alcohol 21 to the aldehyde 22 , the hydroxylamine 23 was obtained as the single diastereomer by an intramolecular reductive coupling reaction promoted by SmI2.
Catalytic hydrogenolysis ( 10 % Pd / C ) in acidic methanol aﬀorded the iminosugar 24 in quantitative yield.
Antroquinonol synthesis was commenced by adding lithium trimethylsilyl acetylide to lactol 9 ( which can be synthesized in a single step by using D-mannose)9 and slightly modifying the process developed by López.10 We observed that K2CO3 / MeOH for the complete dissociation of the treatment is essential trimethylsilyl group , and that the reaction aﬀorded an inseparable mixture ( 2 : 1 ) of the epimeric isomers of diol 10 ( Scheme 2 ) .
A steric bulk presented by the acetonide moiety enabled the mono protection of 10 at C1 hydroxy with TBSCl in CH2Cl2 in the presence of triethylamine to aﬀord TBS ether 11 in 78 % yield.
Subsequently , the other hydroxyl group was transformed to thionocarbonate 12 with excess phenyl chlorothionoformate and pyridine in DCM.
Radical ring closure of the cyclic radical generating an alkene or alkyne is known to aﬀord fused systems11 and is applied in the predominantly cis synthesis of carbasugars.10 Accordingly , when acetylenethiono- carbonate 12 was treated with Bu3SnH and AIBN as a radical initiator in cyclopentyl methyl ether,8 deoxygenative radical cyclization produced exo-methylene cyclohexane 7 in 91 % yield with excellent diastereoselectivity ( cis : trans , 14 : 1 ).
For this purpose , chemoselective deprotection of the six- membered isopropylidene group of 7 was achieved using pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate ( PPTS ) in MeOH to aﬀord diol 13 ( 81 % yield ).
The primary hydroxyl group was transformed to iodo 6 through selective tosylation , followed by iodination with NaI in acetone.
Subsequently , the secondary hydroxyl group was protected using MOM ether to provide an iodo precursor ( 6 ) in 76 % yield over three steps.
To accomplish the crucial coupling of 6 and polyenic vinyl iodide 14,12 we decided to use the Marshall protocol13 for a Suzuki − Miyaura cross- coupling,14 which provided the desired coupling product 15 in 90 % yield ( Scheme 3 ) .
THF and the oxidation of the resultant alcohol with Dess− Martin periodinane provided the requisite enone 5 in 80 % yield.
Deprotection of the cyclic acetonide was performed using CeCl3 and oxalic acid in acetonitrile18 to aﬀord the diol intermediate , which was later dimethylated with a Purdie reagent ( Ag2O , MeI ) to provide a keto compound7b 16 in a 67 % yield over three steps.
Single crystals of 7 were obtained by slow evaporation of CHCl3 solution.
Single crystals of 8 were obtained by −dimethylacetamide slow evaporation of ( DMA ) solution of the compound.
This was then treated with lauryl bromide to give the corresponding 1-hydroxy 2- alkyne 1520 in 70 % yield.
Treatment of this acetylenic alcohol with 6.5 equiv of potassium 3-aminopropylamide ( KAPA ) in 3- aminopropylamine in the acetylenic zipper reaction21 gave the required terminal alkyne 16 in 80 % yield and the resulting primary alcohol was then protected as a TBDPS ether to give 11 in 83 % yield.
guanidino-3-hydroxypentadecanoyl ( GHPD ) side chain.15 ·OEt2 promoted alkylation of terminal alkyne 11 Brieﬂy , BF3 with the chiral epoxide (S)-10 gave the secondary alcohol (R)- 17 in 63 % yield.
The protection of the secondary alcohol as a MOM ether followed by silyl deprotection proceeded smoothly to give the primary alcohol (R)-18 in 73 % yield.
The primary alcohol was then converted to the protected guanidine (R)-19 in 78 % yield upon treatment with di-tert-butoxycarbonylguani- dine under Mitsonobu conditions.22 Concomitant reduction of the internal alkyne and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether using a palladium hydroxide on charcoal catalyst were followed by oxidation of the resulting primary alcohol using ruthenium tetroxide23 to give the carboxylic acid (R)-8 in 43 % yield over the two steps.
The (S)-enantiomer was synthesized in a similar manner , commencing with the opposite enantiomer of the chiral epoxide , (R)-10 , to give (S)-8 in 18 % overall yield .
Synthesis of the (R)-(GHHD) side chain was performed using the same procedures but starting from the reaction of propargyl alcohol 14 with 1-bromodecane to give alkyne 21 , which was subsequently isomerized and protected to give the terminal alkyne 12.20 Reaction of 12 with epoxyalcohol (S)-10 and subsequent manipulation as described above for the longer side chain gave [(R)-9] in 24 % yield over the 6 steps ( Scheme 4 ) .
This reaction was sluggish with some over-reduced side products evident , as previously observed for deprotection of the core of fusaricidin A,15 but under these conditions the free amine 22 was obtained in 59 % yield after RP - HPLC puriﬁcation ( Scheme 5 ).
Amine 22 was then condensed with the side chain fragment (R)-8 using solution phase peptide coupling conditions employing an excess of the coupling reagent HATU and Hünig ’s base in DMF , followed by global removal of the acid labile protecting groups with 90 : 5 : 5 TFA : CH2Cl2:H2O to give (R)-4 in 24 %
Accordingly , naphthalene 5a and 5b were obtained in 70 % and 62 % , respectively.
Indeed , the reaction of 4-bromo- and 2-bromo-phenyl propionaldehydes 4d and 4e yielded the corresponding naphthalenes 5d and 5e with similar yields.
Furthermore , the α substitution on the aldehyde partner was not essential as the reaction of phenylacetaldehyde 4i aﬀorded the expected naphthalene 5i with a slight diminution of yield.
the optimized reaction conditions , 1-phenyl-but-1-yne 6a , 1-phenyl-pent-1-yne 6b , and 1-phenyl-hex-1-yne 6c yielded the corresponding naphthalene compounds 7a − c in good 66 − 70 % yield.
The reaction of 4-chloro- , 4-bromo- , and 4-methyl- substituted alkynes 6d − f aﬀorded the desired products 7d − f with comparable good results ( 62 − 69 % yield ).
The benzannulation of symmetrical alkynes 6g and 6h led to naphthalenes 7g and 7h in 46 % and 49 % yield , respectively.
The eﬀectiveness of this catalytic reaction was further demonstrated by reacting 4-phenyl-but-3-yn-2-one 6i , which aﬀorded the corresponding 2-acetyl-substituted naph- thalene 7i in moderate 46 % isolated yield.
Gratify- ingly , this protocol could also be extended to the use of halogen - substituted phenylacetylenes 6m and 6n , which were scarcely employed in related benzannulation reactions.8 The corresponding 2-chloro- and 2-bromo-substituted aromatic compounds 7m and 7n were obtained in useful 43 % and 42 % yields , respectively.
Pleasingly , starting from 2-phenylpropio- naldehyde 1 and 1-phenyl-1-propyne 2 , the reaction worked perfectly well and led to naphthalene 3 in almost identical yield ( Scheme 5 ).
A branch of this biosynthetic pathway leads to a stereospeciﬁc backbone migration to account the bridgehead methyl substituent.6 This event directly forms the neodolabellanes 9 , which are [9.3.0] - bicyclic diterpenes frequently isolated from various species of coral , albeit in the enantiomeric series.7 The initiation of a transannular reaction of the neodolabellanes ( 9 ) yields the corresponding 5−7−6 tricyclic neodolastanes ( 10 ).
A known Grignard reagent , obtained from (2-bromoallyl)- trimethylsilane , provides for 1,2-addition to 19 to yield the allylsilane 18 for an oxidation leading to butyrolactone and enone formation in the penultimate intermediate 17.
Subsequent epoxidation of 17 , followed by facile desilylation under basic or acidic conditions , would then aﬀord a mild conversion to the allylic alcohol of 2.
In fact , it has proven to be very useful in the stereocontrolled preparations of skipped 1,4- dienes , as shown by additional examples reported in our preliminary studies related to this work.13 The stannane 22 is readily obtained from ethyl 4-benzyloxy-2-methylacetoacetate (24)15 in three steps by stereocontrolled formation of the triﬂate 25,16 reduction , and replacement of the vinylic triﬂate of 26 with a higher - order stannylcuprate reagent.17 The cross-
RCM using the Grubbs II catalyst18 in toluene at 70 ° C yields butenolide 27 ( 99 % ) , and the key aldehyde intermediate 15 is then readily achieved upon TBS deprotection and Dess − Martin oxidation.19 Studies for the formation of the seven - membered ring have focused on the use of SmI2 , which has been generally described
Thus , a reduction of 33 ( LiAlH4 , Et2O ) followed by TBS protection ( TBSOTf , 2,6-lutidine , CH2Cl2 ) yielded the tertiary alcohol 45 ( Scheme 7 ).
Reactions of the hindered ketone 47 with excess methylmagnesium bromide ( 5.0 equiv ) proceeded very slowly at room temperature and led to the isolation of varying amounts of the acyloin rearrangement product 48 as a single diastereomer along with the desired 49 as well as the recovered ketone.
Sub- sequently , we found that the use of newly purchased bottles of methyllithium in ether ( 15 equiv ) aﬀorded modest yields of the desired diol 49 as a single diastereomer [ 40 % yield , 83 % based on recovered starting materials ( brsm ) ] without formation of
TEMPO oxidation33 of 34 led to the syn-elimination of the α-hydroxy ketone using thionyl chloride to aﬀord the enone 50.
Formation of 51 was minimized by adaptation of a published procedure for reaction of the starting ketol with 1,1′- thiocarbonyldiimidazole followed by syn-elimination in o- dichlorobenzene at reﬂux.8a The elevated temperature and prolonged reaction time gave only modest yields of 50 with considerable decomposition using this diastereomer.
Subsequently , an eﬃcient oxidative cleavage in CH2Cl2 using lead tetraacetate yielded the seven - membered enone 54 in 89 % yield .
Deprotection gave an intermediate triol 56 , which aﬀorded
We overcame these diﬃculties by the selective cleavage of the primary OTBS ether of 55 to give 60 of Scheme 9 , followed by oxidation to produce the butyrolactone , which was immediately treated with TBAF to yield allylic alcohol 61.
The SeO2 oxidation of 61 gave the desired 62 together with the related aldehyde ( X = O ).
In practice , our reactions were quenched with a Luche reduction,38 which provided the diol 62 in 60 % yield ( 93 % brsm ) after ﬂash column chromatography , with an additional 33 % of recovered 61 .
Indeed , global deprotection with TAS- F39 led exclusively to the ring - closed natural product , trichoaurantianolide C ( 3 ).
Trichoaurantiolide D ( 4 ) was obtained from synthetic 3 by acetylation [ Ac2O , DMAP , CH2Cl2 ( 80 % )].
Trichoaur- antianolide C ( 3 ) was obtained in 21 steps from the known allylic acetate 21 , and these eﬀorts conﬁrm the original assignment of absolute conﬁguration by the groups of Steglich and Vidari.
To our delight , when the reaction was carried out in the presence of 20 mol % of CuI and 0.50 equiv of 1,8- diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene ( DBU ) in wet methanol at 100 ° C , the desired product , 5-(4-acetylphenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-4- (pyridin-2-yl)furan-3(2H)-one ( 3aa ) , was obtained in an excellent yield after 24 h ( entry 1 ).
Thus , two structurally attractive products 3ac′ and 3an′ , both of which contain two 3(2H)-
Satisfactorily , both acetonitrile ( 2t ) and pentanenitrile ( 2u ) entered the reaction smoothly , furnishing the desired products 3as and 3at in good yields , although higher temperatures are required in these cases.
However , a 2,2,4- trisubstituted 3(2H)-furanone derivative , 2,2-dimethyl-4-(pyr- idin-2-yl)furan-3(2H)-one ( 3av ) , was isolated in 85 % yield.
During the course of our recent studies on enaminone synthesis from aromatic nitriles and ketones ( Scheme 1 , eq 1),16 when 2-bromobenzonitrile was treated with acetophenone in toluene , a cyclized product , 3-arylisoquinolin-1(2H)-one , was observed ( Scheme 1 , eq 2 ).
Fortunately , the desired product , 3-phenyl- isoquinolin-1(2H)-one ( 3a ) , was observed though the yield was unsatisfactory ( entry 1 ).
The desired product 3a was isolated in 82 % yield when 1a was treated with 2a ( entry 1 ).
However , a relatively low yield ( 65 % ) of product 3d was observed when 2-methyl- acetophenone ( 2d ) was treated with 1a ( entry 4 ).
The reactions of ketone substrates 2e−2g bearing an electron - withdrawing group ( F or CF3 ) provided the corresponding products 3e−3g in low to moderate yields ( entries 5 − 7 , 32 % − 76 % ).
Owing to the instability of the iodide the isoquinolone product 3h could be only compound , separated in 50 % yield ( entry 8 ) from the reaction of ketone substrate , 1-(4-iodophenyl)ethan-1-one ( 2h ).
Propiophenone ( 2i ) exhibited low reactivity to produce the isoquinolone product 3i in low yield ( entry 9 , 34 % ).
The reactions of ketone substrates 2j and 2k that have a naphthalene ring proceeded smoothly to provide the corresponding products 3j and 3k in moderate yields ( entries 10 and 11 ; 67 % and 70 % , respectively ).
When 2-chlorobenzonitrile ( 1b ) and 2-iodobenzonitrile ( 1c ) were treated with 2a , the desired product 2a was obtained in moderate yield ( entries 1 and 2 , 53 % or 69 % ) compared with
The reactions of 4-methyl-2-bromobenzonitrile ( 1d ) and 5- chloro-2-bromobenzonitrile ( 1e ) with 2a also proceeded smoothly to produce the desired products 6-methyl-3-phenyl- isoquinolin-1(2H)-one ( 3n ) and 7-chloro-3-phenylisoquinolin- 1(2H)-one ( 3o ) in 72 % and 66 % yields , respectively ( entries 3 and 4 ).
Finally , the nitrile substrates 1b and 1c were examined with 4-methoxyacetophenone ( 2c ) and 4-triﬂuoromethylaceto- phenone ( 2g ) separately to aﬀord the desired products 3c and 3g in low to moderate yields ( entries 5 − 8 , 47 % − 55 % ).
The nucleophilic substitution reaction of 1a with acetophenone under basic conditions could occur via an addition − elimination route to produce intermediate 5 ( SNAr ).
18 Intermediate 5 could undergo electrocyclization in the presence of Lewis acid catalyst Cu(II) and base KOtBu via enolate intermediate 6 to produce intermediate 7.
Protonation of intermediate 7 with HOtBu , generated in the initial step , could produce intermediate 8 , which could convert to the desired product 3a under basic conditions.19 ■ CONCLUSION
We found that a signiﬁcant amount of byproducts with polarity similar to that of C60 was always concurrently formed , although the desired fullerene - fused dioxane 2a was obtained in 17 % isolated yield ( entry 1 , Table 1 ).
Similar treatment of C60 with 1o and 1p in the presence of Fe(ClO4)3 under the optimized conditions also aﬀorded the unexpected fullerene - fused dioxane derivatives 2a and 2b in 20 % and 17 % yield , respectively ( Scheme 2 ).
Addition of complex I to C60 produces fullerenyl radical II , which can undergo coordination with another molecule of Fe(ClO4)3 to form Fe(III) complex III , followed by intramolecular cyclization with the loss of an Fe(II) species to aﬀord fullerene - fused dioxanes / dioxepanes 2.
For the reaction of C60 with diethylene glycol , triethylene glycol , and tripropylene glycol , the ﬁrst two steps are the same as those for fullerene - fused dioxanes / dioxepanes 2 to generate fullerene radical II , which can undergo protonation of the oxygen atom from the ether group to form fullerene radical cation IV.
To our delight , the desired sulfonated azaspiro[4,5]trienone 3a was obtained in 40 % yield when the reaction was carried out by using I2 ( 1 equiv ) and TBHP ( 3 equiv ) in 1,4-dioxane at 80 ° C ( Table 1 , entry 1 ).
After an extensive screening of the reaction parameters , the best yield of 3a ( 89 % ) was obtained by employing of I2O5 ( 1 equiv ) and TBHP ( 3 equiv ) in 1,4- dioxane at 80 ° C ( Table 1 , entry 6 ) .
As expected , the reaction also worked well with alkylalkyne , obtaining the corresponding product 3l in 60 % yield.
Interest- ingly , the para-position substituted N-arylpropiolamides could give the corresponding spiro[4,5]trienone 3a in good yields by releasing the para-substituents ( p-MeO− , p-F , and p-I ) ( eq 1 ).
For example , hydrogenation of alkyne 8aa , prepared in 83 % ee using (R,R)-BnBox as resulted in 2- phenethylchroman ( 9 ) in 87 % yield and 82 % ee ( eq 2 ) .
The complexation of the regioisomeric product gave the NiII complex Ni-3 ( Scheme 2 ) in pure form providing good quality crystals for X-ray structure determi- nation ( Figure 1 ) , which conﬁrmed the accuracy of the substituents assignment and the high regiospeciﬁcity of the proposed synthetic procedure.
Subsequently , Crossley et al.13 have also shown that the reaction of free - base porphyrins with 4.3 equiv of NBS in boiling ethanol - free chloroform aﬀorded the 7,8,17,18-tetra- bromo-substituted porphyrin rather than the misassigned 2,7,12,17-tetrabromo isomer as previously proposed by Callot.20,21 Moreover , Smith et al.36 have described a further attractive synthetic approach to drive a dibromination of porphyrins regiospeciﬁcally on C2 and C3 pyrrolic positions.
The β-disubstituted porphyrinic regioisomer 3 , obtained as a major component by the light - induced procedure i , after chromatographic puriﬁcation successfully reacted overnight in a 1,2-dichloroethane reﬂuxing solution , with Nickel(II) acetyla- cetonate ( Ni(acac)2 ) giving quantitatively the pure NiII- porphyrinate Ni-3 , as shown in Scheme 2.
With the light irradiation , instead , the NBS - mediated bromination has speciﬁcally provided the 2,12-dibromo regioisomer 3 as the major product , the monobromo derivative 2 as the minor component , and only small traces of other dibromo regioisomers and polybrominated derivatives ( 4 ).
We have found that the light - induced bromination of 1 , under rather controlled conditions , occurs regiospeciﬁcally on the 2,12 antipodal positions giving the 2,12-dibrominated porphyrin 3 as the major component with remarkable reaction yields.
When we performed the reaction at this temperature using 1.5 equiv of MeMgBr , branched product 2a was formed with very good regioselec-
4- tert-Butylbenzyl azide ( 1c ) could also provide the quinoline product 3c in moderate yield ( 57 % , entry 3 ).
Arylmethyl azide with mildly electron - withdrawing group , p- substituent ( 1e ) furnished the corresponding 3- phenyl bromoquinoline in good yield ( 75 % , entry 5 ).
chlorophenylmethyl azides ( entries 6 and 8 ) also proceeded well under these conditions and furnished the desired products in good yields ( 65 % and 62 % , respectively ) , whereas m- chlorophenylmethyl azide ( entry 7 ) aﬀorded the separable regioisomeric products ( 3g-1 and 3g-2 ) in lower combined yields ( 44 % ).
p-Fluorophenylmethyl azide ( 1m ) was capable of converting to the corresponding 3-bromoquinoline
To avoid this decomposition , I2- promoted oxidation16 ( condition B ) was applied instead which could provide the desired product 3r in 26 % yield.
the nucleophilic addition of unsymmetrical stilbene 5n to the iminium ion intermediate generated from azide 1a was also examined ( entry 14 ) and was found to aﬀord the desired quinoline 6n-1 as a single regioisomeric product.
To determine the regioselectivity of the product , stilbene 5n was reacted with N-aryliminium ion generated from azide 1j , resulting in quinoline 6n-2 as a single regioisomeric product , which was subjected to an NOE diﬀerence experiment to
Condensation of commercially available , enantiopure tert- butylsulﬁnamide (R)-1 ( > 98 % ee ) with aldehyde 43,13 in the presence of MgSO4 and a catalytic amount of pyridinium p- toluenesulfonate (PPTS)14 gave the saturated N-tert-butylsulﬁ- nylimine 6 in 90 % yield as a single diastereoisomer ( > 99 : 1 dr ) , which was assigned the (E)-conﬁguration by analogy to previous reports concerning this type of reaction14 ( Scheme 1 ) .
Several attempts to trap the magnesium enolate ( s ) generated from treatment of 2 with MeMgBr consistently returned only starting material 2 , although the similar diastereoselectivities of the two imino- aldol reactions using LiHMDS / LiCl and MeMgBr / MgBr2 suggest a similar ratio of the corresponding diastereoisomeric enolates ( Scheme 2 ).
Treatment of 9 with NaOMe in MeOH at 0 ° C for 8 h gave a 20 : 80 mixture of 9 and 10 , respectively.
Removal of the N-tert-butylsulﬁnyl group from 9 ( > 99 : 1 dr ) by treatment with HCl ( 1.25 M in MeOH)9 resulted in the formation of 13 , and subsequent treatment of 13 with racemic tert-butylsulﬁnyl chloride ( 1.0 equiv ) led to the formation of an ∼ 50 : 50 mixture of 9 and ent-11.
Similarly , 10 ( 98 : 2 dr ) was treated with HCl ( 1.25 M in MeOH)9 to furnish 14.
reaction of 14 with racemic tert-butylsulﬁnyl Subsequent chloride ( 1.0 equiv ) gave an ∼ 50 : 50 mixture of 10 and ent- 12.
Thus , removal of the N-tert-butylsulﬁnyl group from 9 ( > 99 : 1 dr ) using HCl ( 1.25 M in MeOH)9 and treatment of 13 with either 312,13 or 43,13 in the presence of NaB(OAc)3H gave 15 and 16 in 63 % and 62 % yield ( from 9 ) , respectively , and in > 99 : 1 dr in both cases.
Puriﬁcation of the crude reaction mixture via Amberlite CG- 400 ion - exchange chromatography ( 100 − 200 mesh , OH− form ) , followed by further puriﬁcation via ﬂash column chromatography on silica gel , gave 17 ( possessing the reported relative conﬁguration within nakinadine D)2 in 60 % yield and > 99 : 1 dr.
As previously described,5 reaction of N-tert-butylsulﬁnamide (R)-1 with aldehyde 5 [ 97 : 3 dr , ( E ) : ( Z ) ratio]4,5,13 gave unsaturated N-tert-butylsulﬁnylimine 7 in 80 % yield and 97 : 3 dr [ (11Z):(11E) ratio].5 Under the optimized conditions for imino-aldol reaction , addition of MeMgBr to a solution of methyl phenylacetate 2 and MgBr2 in THF , followed by addition of imine 7 , furnished an ∼ 80 : 20 mixture of 23 and 24 , respectively.
Puriﬁcation via exhaustive ﬂash column chroma- tography gave 23 in 60 % yield and 97 : 3 dr [ ( Z ) : ( E ) ratio].5,16
When the temperature of the reduced to 70 ° C , complete hydrolysis consumption of 26 occurred after 80 h with no evidence of competing hydration , and puriﬁcation of the crude reaction mixture via Serdolit CG - 400 I ion - exchange chromatography ( 100 − 200 mesh , OH− form ) , followed by further puriﬁcation via ﬂash column chromatography , gave 27 ( the reported in 56 % yield , ∼ 95 % stereostructure of nakinadine F)2 diastereoisomeric purity,18 and > 98 % ee [ based upon the enantiomeric purity of (R)-1].
Deprotection of the N-tert-butylsulﬁnyl group from 24 ( 94 : 3 : 3 dr ) using HCl ( 1.25 M in MeOH)9 gave 29 , which was reacted with aldehyde 5 [ 97 : 3 dr , ( E ) : ( Z ) ratio]4,5,13 in the presence of NaB(OAc)3H to give 30 in 58 % yield and ∼ 93 % diastereoisomeric purity.18 Hydrolysis of 30 using HCl ( 3.0 M aq ) at 70 ° C , followed by puriﬁcation , gave 31 in 58 % yield , ∼ 93 % diastereoisomeric purity,18 and > 98 % ee [ based upon the enantiomeric purity of (R)-1].
Treatment of the crude reaction mixture from the imino-aldol reaction with NaOMe in MeOH at 0 ° C gave an ∼ 20 : 80 mixture of 23 and 24 , respectively , from which 24 was isolated in 60 % yield and 94 : 3 : 3 dr [ (2R,3R,RS,Z):(2R,3R,RS,E) : ( 2S,3R,RS,Z ) ratio],5,17 i.e.
Removal of the N-tert-butylsulﬁnyl group from 23 [ 97 : 3 dr , ( Z ) : ( E ) ratio ] via treatment with HCl ( 1.25 M in MeOH)9 gave 25 , which was subsequently reductively N - alkylated using aldehyde 5 [ 97 : 3 dr , ( Z ) : ( E ) ratio]4,5,13 to give 26 in 60 % yield and ∼ 95 % diastereoisomeric purity.18 Attempted hydrolysis of 26 using HCl ( 3.0 M aq ) at 100 ° C resulted in the formation of a complex mixture of products.
boronic acids 7 were prepared from the corresponding aryl bromides 9 using conventional bromine − lithium exchange followed by the trapping of the anion with trimethylborate ( Scheme 1 ) .
The optically active (S)-ibuprofen was successfully and mildly coupled with (R)-α-methylbenzylamine providing the corresponding amide 15b as a single diastereomer with no epimerization ( see Supporting Information ) .
Surprisingly , 4- iodobenzoic acid required a speciﬁc solvent switch to toluene to deliver 31 with a moderate 34 % yield after optimization.
Finally , α-hydroxyacid required a higher temperature and aﬀorded 32 in 99 % yield at 65 ° C in dichloroethane .
Accordingly , (S)-N-Boc-proline and (S)-N-Boc-phenylalanine were successfully coupled with benzyl amine , providing the corresponding amides 33 and 34 in 92 % and 60 % yields , respectively.
Hydrolysis of the resulting iminium ion ( 3 ) results in α-hydroxymethylated product 4 ( Scheme 1 ) .
32 Our prelimi- nary experiments demonstrated that use of ∼ 3.0 equiv of formalin in a variety of solvents followed by the reduction of crude products with sodium borohydride ( NaBH4 ) provided substantial amounts of allylic alcohol 633 rather than the desired α-hydroxymethylation product 722 accompanied by trace amounts of alcohol 8 derived from the self - condensation of isovaleraldehyde followed by dehydration ( 1.5 : 1 : trace of 6 : 7 : 8 ).
the synthesis of (S)-2-(diphenyl((trimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)- pyrrolidine ( 13 ) , began with esteriﬁcation of commercially available N-Boc-L-proline ( 9 ) producing the corresponding methyl ester 10.
The addition of two equivalents of phenylmagnesium bromide ( PhMgBr ) reagent in THF to ester 10 provided N-Boc-L-diphenylprolinol 11.
The Boc group was then removed by treatment with sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) in ethanol ( EtOH ) at reﬂux to give diphenylprolinol 12.
The addition of 10 mol % of AcOH led to a signiﬁcant amount of elimination product 26 , while the addition of NaOAc had no eﬀect on the formation of the intermediate lactol 15.
Monitoring the reaction in toluene , we observed the presence of equilibrium between the open and closed forms , lactol 15 and hydroxy aldehyde 27 , in favor of the closed form 15 ( 15 : 27 ratio 3 : 1 ) as shown in Scheme 6.
Alternatively , reaction of intermediate 3 or the derived aminol with a second equivalent of formaldehyde could also occur leading to formation of 31.
Subsequent ring closure to aminal 32 , departure of aminocatalyst 1 giving oxonium ion 33 , and ﬁnally quenching with water generates lactol 31 ( Scheme 7 , Pathway B ).
hydroxymethylation of 2-methylbutyraldehyde provided the expected acid 40 ( after oxidation ) bearing a quaternary center with very high enantioselectivity ( Table 4 , entry 4 ).
Particularly noteworthy is the completely regioselective α-hydroxymethylation of an ω-keto- aldehyde to aﬀord keto acid 45 in 87 % yield and 96 % ee .
We were pleased to observe that , with just our ﬁrst attempt , the substrate (Z)-1a was converted to the desired 2,3,5-trienoate product 2aa , which is exclusively in (E)-conﬁguration , and carries a hydroxyl group on the allylic position , almost quantitatively under very mild reaction conditions ; the conversion was complete within just 1 h , when the reaction was performed in the presence of a −CHCl3 ( 0.5 mol % Pd ) and PPh3 ( 2 mol % ) Pd2dba3 combination in MeOH , and under balloon pressure of CO at 25 ° C ( Table 1 , entry 1 ).
The corresponding vinylallene product 2ba was in 96 % yield with a good diastereomeric ratio ( 92 : 8 ) when PPh3 was used as the ligand ( Table 2 , entry 1 ).
The best diastereoselectivity was obtained with the use of an electron - poor phosphine ligand , P(4-CF3C6H4)3 , which aﬀorded 2ba with 94 % yield and 94 : 6 dr within just 30 min ( entry 8 ).
However , when R3 was a carbinol group ( (Z)-1d ) or its hydroxyl group was silyl-protected ( (Z)-1e ) , the corresponding methoxycarbonylated products 2da and 2ea were obtained with 90 : 10 and 89 : 11 dr , respec- tively ( entries 2 and 3 ) .
Though comparably good yields could be achieved with both reagents , the products 2fa and 2ga were obtained with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent level of stereoselectivities , 85 : 15 and 95 : 5 dr , respectively ( entries 4 and 5 ) .
As a model for substrates with all alkyl substituents , the enyne oxirane (Z)-1i , where all R1 , R2 , and R3 positions were occupied by butyl groups , also gave rise to the expected product 2ia with
group in the R2 ( entry 9 ) under the reaction conditions , the this position ( (Z)-1l ) presence of brought about the formation of an allylic esteriﬁed byproduct ( 3la ) along with the desired product 2la with a high dr ( entry 10 ).
8 For instance , when (Z)-1m , which contains a terminal alkynyl moiety , was subjected to the methoxycarbo- the product 2ma was obtained with only 88 : 12 nylation , dr.
Nevertheless , the substrate (Z)-1o ( R1 = t-Bu ) aﬀorded the expected product 2oa in an excellent level of selectivity ( 97 : 3 dr ).
The enyne oxirane (Z)-1s with a phenyl substituent at alkynyl terminus yielded the product 2sa with 88 : 12 dr ( entry 20 ) , and the substrate 1t having an endocyclic double bond also successfully underwent methoxycarbonylation to generate an exocyclic conjugated vinylallene structure 2ta with a relatively lower but synthetically still useful dr ( Scheme 4 ) .
The mechanisms illustrated in Scheme 5 are proposed to account for the stereoselective formation of 2 and 2′.9 The reaction cycle should begin with ring - opening by the attack of a palladium complex to both (Z)-1 and (E)-1 in anti-mode,10 leading to the formation of π-allylpalladium complexes A and A′ , respectively,10d,11 Given the formation of vinylallenes exclu- sively in (E)-conﬁguration for both intermediates ( A and A′ ) , the alkanolate group ( CHR3O− ) on the planar allyl ligand should be oriented syn with respect to the middle allylic C − H.
These σ-allenylpalladium complexes undergo successive CO insertion and reductive elimination , as veriﬁed previously,4,12 to yield 2 and 2′ stereoselectively .
However , the presence of a highly encumbered group , such as tert-butyl , at R2 also retards the eﬀective migration of the π-allyl coordinated palladium , and as a result (Z)-1l partly underwent allylic alkoxycarbonylation to form the byproduct 3la.
The reaction proceeded smoothly in accordance to the proposed mechanism , and thus yielded the vinylallene product 2ia′ , which is the diastereomer of 2ia ( see entry 7 of Table 4 ) , with a high level of dr ( Scheme 6 ).
Using asymmetric (S)-Me-CBS - catalyzed reduction , 2a and its analogues could be prepared in excellent ee values and good yields ; conﬁgurations were also conﬁrmed according to the literature.12 Fortunately , when 2b and 3a were heated in the presence of 5 mol % CuI and 5 mol % PPh3 , desired product 4a formed in more than 97 % ee , > 20 : 1 dr ratio , and 90 % yield after a 24 h reaction ( Scheme 1 ).
was found in the reaction of 2a with 5a , which gave 6a in more than 99 % ee , > 20 : 1 dr ratio , and 77 % yield ( Scheme 1 ).
Using compound (±)-9a with a protected hydroxyl group as the substrate , a reaction with compound 5b generated spiroketal 6v in very low yield ( 5 % ).
Similar the CuI - catalyzed hydro- alkoxylation formed exocyclic enol ether 7a , which was subsequently captured by 3a or 8a to form the spiroketal 4d or 6a.16 Because of the high syn conﬁguration diastereose- lectivity obtained , we propose that the reaction should proceed through transition state I or II ( Scheme 4 ).
The synthesis of the requisite phosphoramidic acid 4 was easily achieved by hydrolysis of the known chlorophosphoramidate 1 ( Scheme 2 ).
The key coupling reaction was initially investigated with DBU salt 8 and nucleoside 2 in the presence of a variety of diﬀerent peptide coupling reagents.22 After extensive screening , the product was obtained in low yield using HBPyU and DMAP in CH3CN / THF at 40 ° C ; encouragingly , product 3 was observed as a 3 : 1 mixture of isomers , favoring the desired P(S) stereochemistry ( Table 1 , entry 1 ).
The combination of HATU and quinine in THF provided the best balance of diastereoselectivity and reactivity , resulting in a 62 % solution yield of 3 in a 7.8 : 1 diastereomeric ratio ( Table 2 , entry 6 ) .
reaction of phosphoramidic acid 8 with uronium - based coupling agents leads to initial formation of uronium ester 12.
After 48 h , the presence of excess BF3 the reaction was quenched with 2N NaOH , aﬀording a mixture of “ quasi enantiomers ” 5 and 6 ( 67 : 33 5a / 6a , 80 % ; 50 : 50 5b / 1H NMR and HPLC analyses ).
This mixture was crystallized from Et2O , aﬀording pure bicyclic intermediate 4a ( 13 % ).
Pure azepinone derivatives 5a ( 45 % ) and 6a ( 10 % ) were isolated after column chromatography of the mother liquors ( Scheme 2 ) .
Finally , the treatment of 4a with NaOH ( 2N , 24 ° C , 30 min ) gave minor stereoisomer 6a in quantitative yield ( Scheme 1 ).
Consequent to the departure of N2 , anti-periplanar migration of the methylene group of the cyclohexyl ring occurs , aﬀording bicyclic salt 3 from A and salt 4 from A′ ( Scheme 1 ) .
Compound 7 was made to react with alanine benzyl ester p-toluene sulfonate [ HOAt ( 1 equiv ) / EDC ( 1 equiv ) / DIPEA ( 2 equiv ) , CH2Cl2 , 25 ° C , 2 h ] to aﬀord dipeptide 8 ( 58 % yield ).
The benzyl group of the ester function was removed by hydrogenolysis ( Pd / C , MeOH , 25 ° C , 24 h ) to give acid 9 ( 90 % , Scheme 3 ).
Any attempt to directly synthesize compound 10 from 5a and H2N-L-Ala-Aib-L-Ala- CONHMe tripeptide failed , probably because of the steric hindrance on the carboxylic function of 7 .
To acquire the necessary quantity of scaﬀold 5a for the peptide synthesis optimization , the reaction between ketone 1 and azide 2a was scaled up to 11 g of 1 , yielding 5a in 47 % yield
We ﬁrst used enynone 1a bearing a p-nitrophenyl group and p- anisidine ( 2a ) to optimize reaction conditions , and an excellent result was obtained immediately : corresponding enamine 3aa was isolated in nearly quantitative yield after an equimolar mixture of initial compounds was stirred in ethanol for 1 h at room temperature ( Table 1 ).
Even in the presence of excess amine the only isolated product was the corresponding enamine 3aa , and no products of addition to the carbonyl group or triple bond were observed.
p-Fluoroaniline ( 2d ) provided high yield of pyrrolinone 4ad , and even anilines with stronger electron- withdrawing groups [ e.g.
, methyl 4-aminobenzoate ( 2e ) and p- triﬂuoromethylaniline ( 2f ) ] furnished the corresponding pyrrolinones 4ae and 4af in 68 % yield.
Mesitylamine 2j reacted smoothly as well , and even sterically crowded 2,6-diisopropylaniline ( 2k ) provided a surprisingly high 80 % yield of corresponding product 4ak demonstrating reaction tolerance to steric hindrances in the aniline core.
We were unable to obtain enamine 3as in Ph2O ( most likely due to poor solubility of benzidine ) , but it was isolated in excellent yield after the reaction mixture was heated in THF.
As expected , enamine 3as smoothly underwent cyclization upon heating in standard conditions leading to the bis-pyrrolone derivative 4as in 72 % yield .
The keystone to developing a synthesis strategy came with recognition that the central THF motif could be constructed by diastereoselective rhodium - catalyzed denitrogenation and re- the β-allyloxy-1-ST 7 into a trans-2,5- arrangement of disubstituted dihydrofuran-3-one 8 ( Scheme 2 ).
Sharpless dihydroxylation11 of readily accessible trans-1-chloro-2-octene (11)12 led to the 1,2-diol 12 with excellent yield ( 95 % ) and enantioselectivity ( > 95 % ee ).
The triazole motif was installed under anionic conditions by treatment of the terminal alkyne with nBuLi followed by TsN3 , resulting in eﬃcient and regioselective formation of the 5- substituted-1-ST 7.15
9g,16 Finally , the homologated compound 6 was treated with hydrogen and palladium on carbon to eﬀect concomitant reduction of the alkene and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether and benzyl ester to complete the synthesis of (+)-petromyroxol ( 1 ) in excellent yield.
Polyaryl substrates also delivered the corresponding hydration products 4c and 4d in high yields.
The transfomation of propargylic ketone 5c formed 6c in 88 % yield , which left enough room for further transformation.
This result of hydration might be due to the competitive Rautenstrauch the Au(I) catalyst.16 rearrangement However , the tertiary skipped diyne 7d underwent hydration to give the mono hydration product 8d , albeit in 54 % yield , by controlling the reaction temperature .
It is worth mentioning here that the hydration of ethyl 4-acetoxy-4-(oxiran-2-yl)-2-alkynoates proceeded smoothly in all cases , forming the corresponding β-keto esters 8ei and 8eii in good to excellent yield without aﬀecting the epoxide functionality.
Chirality retention in the hydration process was examined by preparing enantio-enriched propargyl acetate 10 according to the literature procedure.18 Hydration of enantio-enriched acetate 10 ( 70 % ee ) under the standard conditions cleanly aﬀorded 11 without any loss of the enantioselectivity ( 70 % ee ) ( Scheme 8 ).
However , deacetylation20 of the isotopic hydration product 2b′ gave 2b″ ( 245.0780 [ M + Na]+ ) with the loss of 18O , which favors the proposed mechanism ( Scheme 10 , path a ) .
Bisisothiocyanate 4 was synthesized in three steps from dinitroantroquinone ( 2 ) following the literature.46

Acceptor 5 was prepared smoothly ( 77 % overall ) in two steps from the known5b monosaccharide 10 ( Scheme 1 ).
Treatment with (trichloroethoxy)carbonyl chloride led to the Troc - protected intermediate 11 , which was submitted to − reductive opening of HCl ) , yielding the desired acceptor 5.
Donor 6 was prepared from the known9 anomeric mixture of trichloroethyl glycoside 12 or from the known10 thiotolyl glycoside 14 ( Scheme 1 ).
Glycoside 12 was selectively pivaloylated at O-6 to give triol 13 , which was converted in three steps to alcohol 15 : introduction of a 3,4-O-orthoacetate and in situ O-2 acetylation followed by the acid - catalyzed opening of the orthoester to the O-4 acetate.
Alcohol 15 was then converted to donor 6 in moderate yield ( 26 % from 15 or 24 % from 13 ) over the trichloroethyl group ( 65 % ) , dichloroacetylation at O-1 and O-3 ( 69 % ) , selective removal of the anomeric chloroacetate [ quantitative ( quant ) ] , and then conversion of the resulting hemiacetal to the trichloroacetimidate donor ( 57 % ).
Conversion of triol 14 to alcohol 16 was achieved in 98 % yield following the same sequence of steps described above to prepare alcohol 15 from triol 13.
In turn , chloroacetylation at O-3 of 16 gave tolyl glycoside 17 quantitatively , which was submitted to hydrolytic conditions aimed at removing the thiotolyl group.
4,5d,12 Under these conditions , the desired disaccharide ( 19 ) was obtained in excellent yields and subsequently converted to acceptor 20 by treatment with excess thiourea at 55 ° C.
Glycosylation of acceptor 20 with trichloroacetimidate 7 ( 3 equiv ) under activation with (TMS)OTf ( 1.8 equiv ) at 0 − 10 ° C then gave trisaccharide 21 ( 52 % ) , which was converted to acceptor 22 by treatment with thiourea ( 12 equiv , 70 ° C ).
In contrast , glycosylation in a mixture of DMF and dichloromethane using 6 equiv of donor 9 ( 6 equiv ) activated with copper(II) bromide and tetrabutylammonium bromide at room temperature gave the desired pentasaccharide 25 in 76 % yield.
Treatment of chlorohexyl glycoside 25 with sodium azide in DMF at 80 ° C promptly aﬀorded the 6-azidohexyl analogue 26 in quantitative yield.

In line with previous data,32 treatment of 4a with Hg(OAc)2 in a H2O / THF mixture followed by one - pot addition of NaBH4 to the reaction mixture yielded alcohol 5a as the only isomer in a good 83 % yield.
Under the same conditions , use of bis-benzyl ether 4b as starting material provided 5b with an even better yield the regioisomer 6b were also ( 92 % ) , although traces of detected ( 5 % ).
The same reaction , conducted starting from 7b , provided nucleoside 8b with a slightly better yield ( 37 % ).
suggested that a good yield of 3aa was obtained when the amount of H-phosphonate ( 2a ) increased from 2 equiv to 4 equiv ( entry 22 ).
As expected , the TEMPO - trapped compound 5a was observed ( Scheme 3A ).
The radical nature of these reactions was further conﬁrmed by inclusion of catalytic amounts of inhibitors TEMPO ; product 3aa was formed only to the extent of 24 % ( Scheme 3B ).
Then , reduction by H- phosphonate 2 , producing phosphonyl radical I , water and enolate IV.
Finally , the enolate IV isomerizes and furnishes 3 .
Iodocyclization of diacetylenic alcohol 6 proceeded with the formation of 3-iodobenzothiophene 7.
Appel this compound with iodine aﬀorded diiodobenzothiophene 8 in high yield ( 89 % ).
Under our recently developed one - pot conditions for TMS group removal and Sonogashira coupling,19 reaction of diiodide 8 with TMS- protected enyne 9a proceeded smoothly and also led to the elimination of HI that gave the desired terminal dioleﬁn 10 in high yield ( 79 % , Scheme 1 ) .
The synthesis of electrophilic cyclization of diacetylene 11 gave the mixture of TMS-substituted ethynyl benzothiophene 12 and the desily- lated derivative 13 in high combined yield ( 90 % ) .
In this case , the Cu - catalyzed allylation of the terminal acetylene was a suitable alternative to organometallic reagents.23 Although this reaction is known as a general method for the introduction of allyl moiety and has been extensively applied in the synthesis of natural products,24,25 and even in the synthesis of enediyne systems,26 a one - pot technique for the TMS-group removal / allylation has been reported only once for the KF / CuI - mediated allylation of TMS phenylacetylene in DMF at 80 ° C.27 In our case , much milder conditions were employed : addition of CuI and then allyl bromide to a prestirred mixture of acetylenes 12 and 13 with K2CO3 / MeOH in DMF at room temperature gave the desired enyne 14 in high yield ( 90 % ).
results,19 one - pot desilylation / Sonogashira coupling of iodobenzothiophene 14 with TMS- protected enynes 9a and 9b using a KF / MeOH / diisopropanol- amine system was expected to give the desired dioleﬁns 15 and 16 without any diﬃculties.
Attempted Co-decomplexation from macrocycle 36 was carried out using mild conditions : TBAF in THF , previously −alkyne employed for complexes of some enediynes.51 HRMS data and 1H NMR analysis of the reaction mixture revealed that the triple - bond deprotection gave the desired dienediyne 4.
When the oxidation of cholesteryl acetate ( 1 ) was extended to 2 days , the yield of 5α,6β-diol 2 dropped to 50 % and the more oxidized product , 3β-acetoxy-5α-hydroxycholestan-6-one ( 43 % ) , appeared.
The 6- exomethylene 5α-cholestane derivative 15 , when treated with BSA / TMSOTf , aﬀorded 6-formylcholesteryl acetate 16 in a 40 % yield.
The analogous reaction of 12-exomethylene tigogenin 17 yielded a mixture of 12ξ-hydroxy-12-formyl derivatives 18a and 18b in low yields.
The reaction of lupenyl acetate 19 with benzeneseleninic anhydride in the presence of TMSOTf aﬀorded 3β-acetoxylup-20(30)-en-29-al23 20 in a satisfactory yield ( 75 % ).
Instead , the oxoselenide 22 and the dioxo compound 23 were obtained as products.
When 5 reacted with a stoichiometic amount of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 at room temper- ature in the presence of KOAc , an isolable rollover cyclo- ruthenated intermediate18 7cr was generated , which was characterized by multinuclear NMR and mass spectrometry ( Table 4 ).
Catalytically , the ortho C − H bond in the 1-thienyl moiety of 5 was activated and functionalized to give various new C3 - arylated C1-thienyl-β-carboline derivatives 6a−6i in good yields ( Table 4 ).
The 2-naphthyl starting material 7 reacted with 2a and 2d to yield monoarylated products 8a and 8d via cycloruthenated intermediate 8cr ( see Supporting Information ).
Likewise , 10 reacted with 2d to give 11d , but formation of 12d was not detected due to steric and energetically unfavorable 6-membered cycloruthenated inter- mediate formation .
ABSTRACT : 1-Azulenylcarbene 18 has been generated from 5-(1-azulenyl)- tetrazole and the sodium salt of azulene-1-carbaldehyde tosylhydrazone using the falling solid ﬂash vacuum pyrolysis ( FS - FVP ) method.
Benzofulvenylcarbene 13 has been generated independently by FVP of diazo compound 14 , which yielded 15 at the lowest temperatures , and 16 and 17 at higher temperatures.9,10
However , Sander and co- workers recently published an intriguing reaction , the tunneling 1,4-H ( or 1,10-H ) shift converting 1-azulenylcarbene 18 to fulvene derivative 19 under matrix isolation condition ( Scheme 4 ).
From 1-naphthylcarbene 1 , familiar products 6 and 16 can now be formed.
From 12 and 28 , there are low - energy paths to benzofulvenylcarbenes 13a and 13b , which then cyclizes easily to 16.
When this methodology was applied to ethyl 2,3- butadienoate 10a and enynones ( 11a − c ) , the desired [ 2 + 4 ] annulation products 13aa − ca were obtained in excellent yields and high regioselectivity within 1 h.
In the presence of DABCO , enynal / enynone interacts with intermediate I resulting in II ,
Thus , by using 10 mol % of PPh3 as a catalyst , reaction of ethyl-2,3- butadienoate ( 10a ) with (E)-2-benzylidene-4-phenylbut-3-ynal ( 9a ) provided 14aa and 15aa in a combined yield of 76 % in a 5 : 1 ratio ( Table 4 , entry 1 ).
To begin , the reaction of functionalized cyclopentene 14aa with 5 mol % each of gold(I) carbene complex ( IPrAuCl ) and AgOTf at rt for 3 days in dioxane aﬀorded substituted benzofuran 16aa in 50 % yield ( Table 6 , entry 1 ).
A point worth noting here is that the substrate 14oa undergoes elimination of the trimethylsilyl group resulting in 16oa in excellent yield.
CH(COO-t-Bu) ( 10d ) , the ﬁnal product ( 17 ) after gold catalysis is the one in which decarboxylation also has taken place ( Scheme 5 ).
Initially , gold activated the alkyne end of 14aa to generate III ( Scheme 7 ).
The acceptor moieties were synthesized by reacting 1,4-dibromobenzenze ( 1 ) or 1,3,5-tribromobenzene ( 4 ) with dimesitylboron ﬂuoride ( 2 ) , yielding compounds 3,11 5,12 and 6 ( Scheme 2 ).
13 3 and 6 were coupled to dianisylamine ( 7 ) or an equivalent oligotriarylamine building block (8)10c to aﬀord N-ph-B , N3-ph-B , and N3-ph-B2.
For the second series of donor − acceptor compounds , the starting point was 4-bromo-1-iodobenzene ( 9 ) which was coupled to trimethylsilyl acetylene ( 10 ) to result in compound 11 ( Scheme 3 ).
Product 3a was isolated in 95 % yield as an easily handled , bench - stable , long- life solid salt ; the structure and purity were conﬁrmed by spectroscopic methods , elemental analysis , and chemical reduction with NaBH4 in anhydrous MeCN to diarylmethane 4a in 94 % yield .
We were gratiﬁed by successful reactions with indoles 2a and 2b : salts 3f and 3g were isolated in high yield and purity.
With the aim of conﬁrming the synthetic procedure relevance and of understanding the need for the indole , we took the 4- (N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl scaﬀold into consideration , as it is a well - known stabilizing group in benzhydrylium ions.9 First , we reacted 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzaldehyde ( 1g ) with 1,2- dimethylindole ( 2b ) : tetraﬂuoroborate 3h was isolated in a 97 % yield.
The reaction of 4-methoxybenzaldehyde ( 1a ) with 2,5- dimethylpyrrole ( 2c ) under the conditions optimized for indole gave the tetraﬂuoroborate 3i in 70 % yield.
Quite unexpectedly , the tetraﬂuoroborate 3k was obtained in a very high yield and purity .
Only 1d aﬀorded the tetraﬂuoroborate 3l in good yield and purity , whereas 1a was ineﬀective and 1g gave a dark solid , which , by reduction , furnished only traces of diarylmethane .
Reaction of pyrimidine 2 gave hemiketal 3 that was reduced with ·OEt2 as the Lewis acid.
After triethylsilane ( TES ) using BF3 removal of the tert-butyl protecting groups with triﬂuoroacetic acid ( TFA ) , the desired 1,2-trans compound 4 was obtained as a single anomer.
Subjection of perbenzylated lyxonolactone 7 to methyl or phenyl lithium did not yield the desired ketofuranoses but only led to furan 14 , as the result of a double β-elimination sequence.
Reaction of Weinreb amide 15 with methyl or phenyl lithium delivered the open chain ketones 16 and 17 .
Hence , (−)-sclareol was transformed into the hyrtiosanes 5 and 6 ( epimers in C-16 ) , as reported earlier.12 To test our ﬁrst hypothesis , we submitted 5 − 6 to a “ Prins - type
Oxidation of the mixture of 11 − 12 with MnO2 in DCM25 gave diketone 19 , which was the key compound for the synthesis of the natural products.
Reduction of 19 with sodium borohydride26 gave hydroxyketone 20 and diol 21.
Mesylation of 20 in the usual conditions27 gave mesylate 22 , which was not isolated and submitted to further transformation.
The inversion of the conﬁguration at C-18 was ﬁnally achieved by treatment of mesylate 22 with KNO2 / DMSO28 at 70 ° C for 7 h , obtaining compound 2.
From compound 2 , by acetylation of the hydroxyl group at C-18 , the acetyl derivate 23 was obtained.
Ulterior reduction of 23 with sodium borohydride gave compound 1 in excellent yield ( Scheme 4 ).
We ﬁrst attempted the Suzuki - Miyaura cross-coupling of 8 with bromoamine 5 using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)- palladium and the conditions employed to prepare the diamine precursor to diradical 1.14 However , the reaction failed to yield the target diamine 6.
Finally , we modiﬁed the conditions of Fu and co-workers , who employed the Pd2(dba)3 / P(t-Bu)3 / KF catalytic system,21 by using the Pd[P(t-Bu3)]2 / K3PO4 catalytic system and we obtained target diamine 6 in low yield ( Scheme 1 ) .
Here we report a successful application of this reaction to incorporate hydroxyl groups stereoselectively onto the aldehyde 3 to synthesize galacto-DNJ ( 1 ) and altro-DNJ ( 2 ).
Asymmetric aminoxylation of 3 , followed by stabilized Wittig reaction and reduction of the N − O bond , gives the secondary allyl alcohol A.
Dihydroxylation of A followed by reduction of the ester to a primary alcohol and its activation as a mesylate gives B.
Simultaneous deprotection of the N-Boc group and acidolysis of the oxazolidine ring in B gives primary amine C as a salt.
Treatment of C with a suitable base leads to intramolecular displacement of the mesylate to give cyclic derivatives , which on deprotection can give 1 and 2.
Acidolysis of 10a with methanolic HCl followed by treatment with K2CO3 yielded the 3-O-benzyl derivative 11a of 1 in 76 % yield.
Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl group using Pd / C and H2 in methanol completed the synthesis of 1 in 35 % overall yield from 3 .
In order to ascertain the stereoselectivity achieved in this reaction , aminoxylation of 3 catalyzed by D- proline and L-proline were followed with reduction of the aldehyde to an alcohol using NaBH4 to get 12a and 12b respectively ( Scheme 3 ).
12a and 12b were converted to the diols 13a and 13b , respectively by cleaving the N − O bond using Cu(OAc)2 .
Using a very similar strategy used for the synthesis of 1 and carrying out the initial α-aminoxylation of 3 in the presence of L-proline , we were able to synthesize 1-deoxyaltronojirimycin ( 2 ) in 37 % overall yield ( Scheme 4 ).
The stereoselective the hydroxyl group in 5b controlled the formation of the benzyl derivative 6b using Upjohn dihydroxylation of conditions to get 7b diastereoselectively.
The diol 7b was converted to 2 using the same sequence of reactions used for the synthesis of 1 from 7a .
silica bed and was treated with Cu(OAc)2 in EtOH to cleave the N − O bond , and the alcohol 5a was obtained in 69 % overall yield for the three steps.
The secondary hydroxyl group in 5a was protected as a benzyl derivative to get 6a in 94 % yield.
Dihydroxylation of 6a using the Upjohn conditions9c,10 with OsO4 ( 5 mol % ) and NMO ( 2 equiv ) in a mixture of acetone and water ( 8 : 1 ) yielded the diol 7a in 92 % as the only diastereomer.
The diol was protected as an acetonide using 2,2-dimethoxypropane ( DMP ) in the presence of TsOH in reﬂuxing toluene to get 8a , which was reduced with LiAlH4 to get the primary alcohol 9a in 91 % yield from 7a.
The primary hydroxyl group was converted to the mesylate 10a in excellent yield with MsCl in the presence of
The mesylate 15 was prepared by treating 14 with MsCl and triethylamine in the presence of a catalytic amount of DMAP.
The absolute conﬁguration of 16 was conﬁrmed by comparing its optical rotation and spectral data with the reported values.11,4b Jones oxidation of the primary alcohol group in 16 and hydrogenolysis of the crude product gave the N-Boc derivative 17 of 4 in 60 % yield ( Scheme 5 ) .
In contrast to IOOC , we reported that O-silylated oximes 6 having oleﬁn ·OEt2 , underwent intramolecular moieties , on treatment BF3 cycloaddition via N-boranonitrones 7 under very mild conditions.6 More recently , it was also reported that intermolecular cycloaddition of C-ester substituted O-silylated oxime 8a aﬀorded 3,5-trans-cycloadducts as the major isomers.7 In this paper , we would like to report that cycloaddition of C- · amide substituted O-silylated oxime 8b in the presence of BF3 OEt2 produces 3,5-cis-cycloadducts predominantly probably via ·14 ( Scheme 3 ).
The starting O-silyl oxime 8b was readily prepared from tartaric acid dimethyl amide ( 9 ) in 3 steps ( Scheme 2 ).
Thus , oxidative cleavage of 9 with periodic acid yielded aldehyde 10.8
Aldehyde 10 was exposed to hydroxylamine leading to the oxime , hydroxyiminoacetic acid N,N-dimethylamide,8 which was silylated with tert-butyldimethylcholorosilane under stand- ard conditions to provide oxime 8b.
However , no ·OEt2 reaction occurred , and then addition of 1 equiv of BF3 induced cycloaddition to produce cycloadduct 13b after extractive workup followed by Boc-protection.
Reaction of styrene ( 11a ) proceeded almost quantitatively to give 13a ( entry 1 ).
Cyclopentene ( 11e ) also reacted with ·OEt2 to aﬀord a 5.3 : 1 8b in the presence of 2.2 equiv of BF3
The Boc group of cycloadduct cis-13a obtained from silyl oxime 8b and styrene ( 11a ) was removed by treatment with CF3CO2H and the resulting N-nonsubstituted isoxazolidine was acylated with dodecanoyl chloride under Schotten- Baumann conditions to give N-acylated isoxazolidine 17 in 55 % yield.
Heating 17 with Mo(CO)6 in MeCN − H2O caused reductive cleavage of N − O bond to aﬀord lactone 19 and 1,3- amino alcohol derivative 18 , which could be transformed to lactone 19 by heating in toluene.
Finally , the lactone 19 was reduced to alcohol with NaBH4 to provide syn- HPA-12 ( rac-16 ) ( Scheme 6 ) .
Hydride reduction of an N-alkoxycarbonyl protecting group should furnish ht-13-B.
Finally , compound 4 was thought to be derived from diastereoselective allylation of the known pyrrolidine 1 via an acyliminium ion type intermediate.
11 Introduction of the allyl side chain was achieved using allyl trimethylsilane in the presence of titanium tetrachloride to aﬀord 2.12 The Boc-protecting group was unexpectedly removed during the course of the reaction prior to puriﬁcation.13 In addition , the product mixture proved to be sensitive to puriﬁcation by chromatography on silica gel.
Removal of the t- butyldimethylsilyl group using tetrabutylammonium ﬂuoride ( TBAF ) aﬀorded the diastereomeric compounds 4 and 5.
A Mitsunobu reaction of major isomer 4 with 2-bromo-3- nitrophenol (6)15 using triphenylphosphine and diisopropyla- zodicarboxylate ( DIAD ) gave expected product 7 in 70 % isolated yield ( Scheme 3 ).
Intramolecular Heck reaction16 of 7 gave only 8-endo trig cyclization products 8 in low isolated yields.17,18 The expected 7-exo trig cyclization to aﬀord 9 was not observed by 1H NMR of the crude reaction mixture.
Treatment of 1 with an excess of 2- bromo-2-propen-1-yltrimethylsilane (10)23 aﬀorded allylation product 11 , again with the loss of the Boc-protecting group ( Scheme 4 ).
24 In addition to 11 , bicyclic compound 12 was also isolated as a mixture of diastereomers.

Removal of the TBS group with TBAF to give 15 followed by a Mitsunobu reaction with 2-bromo-3-nitrophenol ( 6 ) gave anticipated compound 16.
Stille − Kelly reaction of 16 with hexamethylditin in the presence of a catalyst system consisting of bis- (dibenzylidenacetone)-palladium(0)-triphenylphosphine pro- duced desired tricyclic compound 17.
Palladium - catalyzed reductive N-heterocyclization of 17 in the presence of carbon monoxide gave expected tetracyclic indole 18 , the immediate precursor to the alkaloid ht-13-B , as a single isomer.
Finally , the N-methoxycarbonyl protecting group of 18 was reduced to a methyl group using sodium bis(2- methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride ( Red-Al ) in toluene at 110 ° C to aﬀord ht-13-B in high isolated yield.29 Reduction of 18 using a large excess of lithium aluminum hydride ( LAH ) in reﬂuxing tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) was also attempted ; however , this only resulted in complete recovery of the starting material.
The 4-alkyl- or silyl- substituted 1-(siloxymethyl)-1,4-epoxy-1,4-dihydronaphtha- lene was transformed to o-NQM ( 1-naphthoquinone-2- methide ) , which underwent Friedel − Crafts 1,4-addition of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety to provide the 2-benzyl-1- naphthol as the biarylmethane and [ 4 + 2]-cycloaddition with a dienophile to give the fused heterocyclic arene.
Mean- while , the 4-unsubstituted 1-(siloxymethyl)-1,4-epoxy-1,4- dihydronaphthalene could be converted to the corresponding 4-benzyl-1-naphthol by the Friedel − Crafts 1,6-addition of p-NQM ( 1-naphthoquinone-4-methide ) generated by the site - selective ring opening of the 1,4-epoxy moiety.
Furthermore , the 4-(siloxymethyl)-(1,4-bis(siloxymethyl))-1,4-epoxy-1,4-dihydronaphthalene was transformed into a 2,4-bisbenzyl-1-naphthol or pentacyclic derivative via both the o- and p-NQM intermediates .
Consequently , (CH2Cl)2 was the most eﬃcient among the tested solvents including CH2Cl2 , CHCl3 , CH3CN , CH3NO2 , and THF ( entries 8 vs 1 and 10 − 13 ) , and the increased amount of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene to 4 equiv could improve the reaction eﬃciency to give 2a in 88 % yield ( entry 9 ).
The o-NQM derivative ( A ) derived from the FeCl3 - catalyzed transformation of 1a eﬃciently reacted with various arene nucleophiles ( 1,3-dimethoxybenzene,17 anisole,17 2- or 1-methoxynaphthalene , and N-phenylindole18 ) at room temperature
Meanwhile , benzofuran worked as a dienophile in the reaction with o-NQM ( A ) , and the fused pentacyclic arene derivative including the heterocyclic component ( 3a ) was obtained in 74 % yield ( entry 6 ).
While indene and styrene also underwent the same annulation with o-NQM ( entries 7 and 8 ) , the reaction of benzothiophene gave 2-[(benzothienyl)methyl]-1- naphthol ( 2g ) ( entry 9 ).
19 Furthermore , the 4-silylated substrate ( 1b , 1-[(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)methyl]-4-(triethyl- silyl)-1,4-epoxy-1,4-dihydronaphthalene ) was also applied to the FeCl3 - catalyzed reaction using 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as a nucleophile to give the corresponding 2-benzyl-4-silyl-1- naphthol derivative ( 2ha ) ( entry 10 ).
During the reaction , the TES group was partially cleaved probably by the nucleophilic attack of the chloride anion derived from FeCl3 on the silicon atom , and the 2-benzyl-4-hydro-1-naphthol derivative ( 2hb shown in eq 1 ) was obtained as a byproduct .
The use of FeBr3 as a stronger Lewis acid could complete the subsequent cleavage of the TES group after the formation of 2ha to give 2hb as the sole product ( eq 1 ).
The stability of the TES − Ar bond strongly depended on the characteristic feature of the product , and the FeCl3 - catalyzed reaction of 1b in the presence of N-phenylindole and the 6,7-bismethoxy-4-silyl substituent ( 1c ) with 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene provided the desilylated products ( 2i and 2j ) ( entries 11 and 13 ) , while the TES group remained during the reaction using benzofuran ( entry 12 ).
While the reaction of the 4-alkyl- or silyl-1-(siloxymethyl) substrates ( 1 ) and nucleophilic arenes gave the 2-benzyl-1- naphthol derivatives ( 2 ) ( Tables 1 and 2 ) , the 4-benzyl-1-naphthol
a37 % of 1-(triﬂuoroacetyl)-2,4,6-trimethoxybenzene ( 9 , Scheme 2 ) was obtained as a byproduct.
Although the catalytic use ( 5 mol % ) of triﬂuoroacetic acid ( TFA ) as a Brønsted acid was less eﬀective ( entry 4 ) , the stoichiometric amount ( 1 equiv ) of TFA eﬃciently facilitated the desired reaction to give 5a in 78 % yield ( entry 5 ).
Intriguingly , the reaction using triﬂuoroacetic anhydride ( TFAA , 1 equiv ) as a neutral additive also eﬀectively provided 5a in quantitative yield accompanied by the formation of 2-[(triﬂuoromethyl)carbonyl]-1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene ( 9 , 37 % yield ) ( entry 6 ) , which indicated that TFA ( ca.
1-Methoxynaphtha- lene , 2-methoxynaphthalene , and N-phenylindole were reacted with 4a to give the corresponding 4-[(hetero)arylmethyl]-1- naphthol derivatives 5b − d ( entries 1 − 3 ) , and the substrate possessing bromines at the 6 and 7 positions ( 4b ) was also applied to provide the 6,7-dibromo-1-naphthol derivative ( 5e ) ( entry 4 ).
The subsequent rearrangement of the siloxymethyl group to the 2-position ( C → D ) and the aromatization provides a 2-(siloxymethyl)-1- intermediate ( E ).
20 The further FeCl3 - catalyzed naphthol elimination of the siloxy group21 gives o-NQM ( A ) , which reacts with an arene by nucleophilic attack or a dienophile via the [ 4 + 2]-cycloaddition into the corresponding 2-benzyl-1- naphthol or the condensed heterocyclic arene derivative , respectively.
The following aromatization gives the 4-(siloxymethyl)-1-naphthol intermedi- ate ( I ).
It is noteworthy that the FeCl3 - catalyzed double function- alizations via both the o- and p-NQMs derived from the 1,4- bis(siloxymethyl) 1,4-epoxy-1,4-dihydronaphthalenes ( 6 ) gave the corresponding bifunctionalized products ( 7 and 8 ) ( Table 5 ) .
First , the FeCl3 - catalyzed ring - opening reaction of the 1,4-epoxy moiety of the substrate ( 6a ) and the subsequent rearrangement and aromatization produced the 1,4-bis(siloxymethyl)-1-naphthol ( J ) intermediate as shown in Scheme 2.
o-NQM ( K ) is then initially generated to provide a 2-benzyl-1-naphthol , which is transformed into p-NQM ( L ).
After full consumption of the propargylic acetate , azide addition indeed provided triazole 2 in high yield with retention of the stereochemistry.
However , prior deprotonation of the amine with n-butyllithium followed by condensation with a phosphorus chloride gave the desired P,N - ligands 3 in almost quantitative conversion ( Table 2 ).
material due to decomposition.29 Therefore , we decided to skip isolation of the ligands 3 and immediately perform complex- ation with Ir and counteranion exchange to give Ir − BArF complexes 4.
On spectroscopic characterization , the product was found to be 2- (2-(methylthio)phenyl)pyridine ( 2a ).
We were excited to ﬁnd that , with 2.0 equiv of copper acetate and DMSO as the solvent , 2-(3-(methylthio)naphthalen-2-yl)pyridine ( 2b ) was obtained as a single product in 89 % yield at 125 ° C ( Table 1 ) .
In an unusual ﬁnding though , we found that thiolation occurred at the more hindered ortho-position of 2-(3-methylphenyl)pyridine to yield 2j in 67 % yield.
Further , with CuCl2 as the catalyst , a chlorinated product , 2-chloro phenylpyridine ( 2aa ) , was isolated in 50 % yield.
As expected , 2- (3-methylphenyl)pyrimidine with a methyl substituent at the meta-position underwent the less- hindered ortho-site to yield 4c in 58 % yield .
With 1b as the substrate , deuterated thiomethyl derivative 2bb was obtained in 82 % yield , conﬁrming that the sulfur atom was being transferred from DMSO ( Scheme 2 ) .
This was identiﬁed as Cu2O from PXRD20 data ( see the Supporting Information ) and was believed to be the byproduct of Cu(OAc)2 mediated oxidation of methanethiol to dimethyl disulﬁde21 ( Scheme 4 ).
On the basis of these observations , we believe that the reaction is initiated by coordination of A ( generated in situ and veriﬁed by GC − MS ) to 1a to yield the complex B , which also explains the observed ortho-selectivity.23 This is followed by metalation and deprotonation to yield C with the elimination of acetic acid.
Cu(OAc)2 promoted oxidation of Cu(II) to high valent Cu(III) species D takes place next , which is followed by reductive elimination to yield the product 2a and Cu(I) , which gets reoxidized to Cu(II) under an air atmosphere and enters back into the catalytic cycle.
In the second case , only the thioethyl derivative ( 10 ) was formed , and no traces of 2k were seen.
Workup of the crude reaction mixture by column chromatog- raphy resulted in 84 % of the functionalized peptoid 5a .
Analysis of the collected reaction mixture indicated a quantitative reaction with the limiting formaldehyde reagent 7a being fully converted into peptoid 5a.
Careful analysis revealed that the monomeric cyclopeptoid 6b was selectively formed instead of the dimeric derivative.
Thus , when 1-iodo-2- methylbenzene was used , the corresponding product was 5aj isolated in a poor yield ( 17 % ).
Finally , it is worth noting that the reaction may be scaled up : the reaction of 1.57 g of N-benzylpyrrole ( 10 mmol ) gave 2.53 g ( 82 % yield ) of 5aa ( eq 3 ) .

Given the Platz group ’s observations of diﬀering photochemistry between noradamantyldiazirine versus adamantyldiazirine , we were surprised by the formation of exocyclic alkenes 4b-Ph from the cophotolysis of adamantyldiazirine 1b and phenylchlor- odiazirine 8 that paralleled the alkenes obtained from the noradamantyl system ( i.e.
We are thus left with two mechanistic possibilities : path B / B′ via stepwise addition of PhCCl to bridgehead alkene 3a or 3b to yield singlet diradical 10a-Ph or 10b-Ph and / or path F / F′ via PhCCl addition to diazo compound 6a or 6b.
Our design was started by investigating the reaction of styrene 1a with NHPI 2a using 10 % CuCl as catalyst in 1,2- dichloroethane ( DCE ) , and a 21 % 3a was produced ( Table 1 , entry 1 ).

The alcohol 4a can be further oxidized to give the ketone 5a under the copper catalysis conditions.
The acid hydrolysis of the bicycle 23 under a wide range of conditions , followed by treatment of the crude product with sodium borohydride , only gave traces of the triol 34.

Alkyl ketones 2g and 2h were also suitable nucleophilic reagents , leading to the formation of 3ag and 3ah in moderate yield , although two inseparable isomers were obtained in these cases ( entries 6 and 7 , the molar ratio of the isomers is 1 : 0.35 ).

To obtain benzyl-protected CDB 6 , compound 14 was demethylated with the Lewis acid BBr3 ,
The carboxylic acid in 16 was converted to acid anhydride and selectively reduced with NaBH4 to obtain an alcohol 17.
The alcohol 17 was then subjected to Mitsunobu reaction with protected hydroxylamine to yield compound 18.

The intermediate [A] was then treated in ethanol under reﬂuxed conditions using PTSA as catalyst , which aﬀorded the product 5a.
First , it was observed that the imine 3 also forms when acetonitrile is used as solvent instead of ethanol ( Scheme 3 ).
The reaction occurred smoothly to aﬀord the desired compound 7a ( R1 = Me , Ar = Ph , R2 = Me ) in good yield ( Scheme 3 ).
The formation of further established by isolating the intermediate [B] ( Ar = Ph , R1 = Me , R2 = CH3 ) obtained by performing the reaction of 3 ( R1 = CH3 ) and 6 ( R2 = CH3 ) at room temperature , which , on reﬂuxing in ethanol in the presence of PTSA , or in acetonitrile in the presence of FeCl3 as catalyst , aﬀorded the compound 7a ( R1 = Me , Ar = Ph , R2 = Me ) ( Scheme 3 ) .
However , the reaction of anilines 1 , under arylglyoxals 2 , and indoles 6 produced bis-indolyl methane derivatives 8 instead of biindoles without involving aniline in the reaction process.
Formation of such bis-indolyl methanes is well documented.20 Again , the use of FeCl3 as catalyst in CH3CN under identical conditions produced the desired compounds 5 and 7 in good yield .
By using sodium borohydride in ethanol , the expected compound 2 was not obtained.
This type of reactivity has already been reported.6 By using LiAlH4 as reducing agent , degradation of the reaction mixture was observed ( Table 1 , entry 3 ) , but treatment of compound 1 with 1.5 equiv of diisobutylaluminium hydride in THF at room temperature provided the desired imidazo[1,2-a]- imidazole derivative 2 in a good yield of 74 % ( Table 1 , entry 4 ) .
With the 3-methoxy substituent , 3 equiv of DIBAL- H was necessary to complete the reaction and provide the imidazo[1,2-a]imidazole 10 in 83 % yield ( Table 2 , entry 3 ).
When the reaction was performed using 0.2 equiv of tri-o- tolylphosphine ( P(o-tolyl)3 ) the diarylated compound 15 was not detected , but conversion was limited to 36 % ( Table 3 , entry 7 ).
The use of 0.2 equiv of (2-furyl)phosphine ( P(2- furyl)3 ) improved conversion , but the unwanted compound 15 were observed ( Table 3 , entry 8 ).
The monoarylated product 14 was isolated in 72 % yield.
Moreover , 4-bromopyridine was also easily coupled , and the corresponding 3-aryl-2-(hetero)- arylimidazo[1,2-a]imidazoles 38 and 40 were cleanly obtained in 64 and 66 % yield ( Table 5 , entries 3 and 5 ) .
β-Lactams 1 and 4 ( Scheme 1 ) were prepared as single cis-diastereoisomers from imines of indole-2- carboxaldehydes through Staudinger reaction with the appro- priate alkoxyacetyl chloride in the presence of Et3N.8 Transesteriﬁcation of 3-acetoxy-2-azetidinones 1a − f with sodium methoxide in methanol gave 3-hydroxy-2-azetidinones 2a − f , which , by treatment with propargyl bromide under basic indoles 3a − f conditions , gave 2-azetidinone - tethered alkynyl ( Scheme 1 ).
Terminal alkynes 3 and 4 were conveniently converted into allenes 5 and 6 ( Scheme 2 ) by treatment with paraformaldehyde in the presence of diisopropylamine and copper(I) bromide ( Crabbé reaction ).
system [AuClIPr] ( IPr = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)- imidazol-2-ylidene ) ( 5 mol % ) / AgSbF6 ( 5 mol % ) in 1,2- dichloroethane ( DCE ) at room temperature for 5 h , indolo- oxepino β-lactam 7a was isolated in 72 % yield ( Table 1 , entry
When the reaction was allenyl performed at 40 ° C , it proceeded rapidly and gave a separable mixture ( 1 : 1 ) of tetracycle 7a and tricycle 8a.
When indolo-oxepino β-lactam 7a ·6H2O with the same catalyst ratio ( 5 was treated with HSbF6 mol % ) , no product 8a was obtained , the participation of the Brønsted acid in the ring - opening process.
In contrast , reaction of 7a with a catalytic amount of [IPrAuSbF6] under otherwise identical conditions gave the dihydro-oxepino[4,5-b]indole-4- carboxamide 8a in excellent yield.
4‑(methylthio)benzaldehyde was allowed to react with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in DMSO to aﬀord the 4‑(methylthio)benzonitrile ( 1 ) in 84 % yield via aldehyde oxime formation and spontaneous dehydratization at a temperature of 100 ° C as described by Chill and Mebane for other nitriles.25 The oxidation with m-chloroperbenzoic acid formed 2a in a yield of 77 % .
Therefore , 6i was demethylated using BBr3 in DCM to give the 4-hydroxy- phenyl-substituted dihydropyrrolo[3,2,1-hi]indole 6j in 91 % yield.
Then 2-ﬂuoroethyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonate 7 , prepared by the reaction of 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride and 2- ﬂuoroethanol in THF with KOSiMe3 , was allowed to react with 6j in THF using KOtBu as a base.
This gave the 2-ﬂuoroethoxy- substituted dihydropyrrolo[3,2,1-hi]indole 6k in 55 % yield , a compound that can serve as reference for the radiosynthesis of the corresponding 18F-radiolabeled PET - tracer.
In principle , compound 7 can directly undergo keto- enol tautomerization in its native form to yield 7(4) , as in Scheme 5a.
The gram - scale reaction was performed between 1f and 6b , and the reaction aﬀorded 7c in 89 % yield ( Scheme 3 ).
As shown in Scheme 4 , coupling of 2,4-dichlorobenzenethiol ( 1r ) with 3-chloroaniline ( 8b ) provided 9a in 92 % yield under the standard conditions , which was used as inhibitors of LFA-1 / CAM-1,23 suggesting that the developed method would be applied in the medical industry.
When 4- methylbenzenethiol ( 1f ) was added independently under the standard conditions , 1,2-di-p-tolyldisulfane ( 10 ) was obtained in 97 % yield.
Initially , 4-methylbenzenethiol ( 1f ) was oxidized to 1,2-di-p-tolyldisulfane ( 10 ) under the standard conditions.
The reaction of 10 with I2 formed 2 equiv of an electrophilic species p-MePhSI (I),21 which attacked 4- chloroaniline ( 6b ) to yield II.
Treatment of 1 with diisobutylaluminum hydride ( DIBAL-H ) in THF followed by addition of N- bromosuccinimide ( NBS ) gave 2-bromo-3-[2-bromo-2- (trimethylsilyl)vinyl]naphthalene 2 as an inseparable mixture with 2-bromo-3-[2-(trimethylsilyl)vinyl]naphthalene.
2 equiv of nBuLi , followed by sequential treatments with dichloro(phenyl)phosphine and hydrogen peroxide , aﬀorded 2-(trimethylsilyl)naphtho[2,3-b]phosphole P-oxide 3.
Bromolysis of the C(sp2)−Si bond of 3 with NBS produced bromide 4 as a colorless solid .
The reaction of 4 with 5a in the presence of catalytic amounts of Pd(OAc)2 ( 10 mol % ) and P(bp)Cy2 ( 20 mol % ) in acetonitrile − toluene − water ( 2 : 2 : 1 v / v / v ) at 90 ° C ( bath temperature ) for 1 h gave 2-phenylnaphtho[2,3-b]phosphole P- oxide 6a in 84 % isolated yield after silica - gel column chromatography ( Scheme 2 ).
ether 12 was prepared from cis-2-butene-1,4-diol in two steps by following the literature procedures.32 After conversion of 12 to an acetonide form (13),33 the benzylic groups ( Bn ) were removed reductively.
The produced diol 14 was then treated with methanesulfonyl chloride ( MsCl ) to give dimesylate 15.34 cis-DHSred ( 6 ) was obtained by selenation of 15 with sodium hydrogen selenide ( NaHSe ) and subsequent deprotection of the acetonide group.
Starting from diols 17a and 17b , which were prepared in eight and seven steps , respectively , from cis-2-butene-1,4-diol by following the literature procedures,36−39 target selenides 9 and 10 were obtained in three steps through mesylation and selenation of the hydroxyl groups and subsequent deprotection of the Boc groups.
spectrum , formation of disulﬁde DTT ( DTTox ) was observed ( see 1H NMR spectra in the Supporting Information ).
Though none of the expected cross-coupling product was observed , we found that the starting materials were consumed completely and converted cleanly to a new product ( 6 ) .
By the synthetic pathway described previously , 1- adamantanol aﬀorded the desired H-adamantylphosphinates (±)-3a and (±)-3b from commercially available dichlorophe- nylphosphine and o-tolyldichlorophosphine with 95 % and 90 % yields , respectively ( Table 1 , entries 1 and 2 ).
21 From that perspective , compounds 3a,c,f,g were reacted with formaldehyde to form optically pure phosphinates 6a,c,f,g .
Conﬁrming the advantage of the adamantyloxy group as a leaving group aﬀording substitutions without the enantiomeric excess , compound 7a reacted smoothly with primary alkyllithiums to give the corresponding phosphine− borane 8a,b with inversion of conﬁguration at the phosphorus atom ( Scheme 5 ).
Regioselective PMB protection16 of the secondary alcohols of adenosine 18 provided a 3 : 1 mixture of 2′-OPMB adenosine 19 and 3′-OPMB adenosine 20 in 75 % yield.
Without separation of regioisomers , subsequent tritylation of the 5′-OH and 6-NH2 aﬀorded a 3 : 1 mixture of 21 and 22 that was ﬂuorinated with attendant inversion of conﬁguration using DAST17 to obtain 23 ( 55 % from 21 ) and 24 ( 42 % from 22 ) , which were easily separated by chromatography.
Dess − Martin periodinane ( DMP ) mediated oxidation of 21 to 3′-ketoadenosine derivative 25 , which was stereoselectively reduced with sodium triacetoxyborohydride to furnish alcohol 26.
Fluorination of 26 with DAST gave 27 in 61 % yield.
The novel diﬂuorinated nucleoside 2′,3′-dideoxy-2′,3′-FF- xylo 31 was synthesized from 2′-ﬂuoroadenosine 2820 by trityl protection to provide 29 , and subsequent treatment with DAST furnished 31 in 62 % overall yield ( Scheme 3 ).
The diﬂuorinated 2′,3′-dideoxy-2′,3′-FF-ribo 35 was pre- pared from the known lyxo-epoxide21 32 ( Scheme 4 ) following the Watanabe two - step process initiated by epoxide opening with a ﬂuoride ion exclusively from the α-face of the sugar to aﬀord a 3 : 1 ratio of regioisomers 3′-ﬂuoro-arabino 33 and 2′- ﬂuoro - xylo 34 in a 65 % combined yield.
ABSTRACT : High - temperature , TiCl4 - catalyzed , triple aldol condensations of aceanthrenone 5 and acenaphthacenone 6 gave tribenzodecacyclene 3 and hexabenzodecacyclene 4 , respectively , in yields of 16 and 0.8 % , respectively.
Indeed , treatment of aceanthren-1-one12 ( 5 ) with TiCl4 in reﬂuxing o-dichlorobenzene ( ODCB ) gave tribenzodecacyclene 3 , a red , crystalline solid that was easily isolated in 16 % yield ( chieﬂy because it is brightly colored and the least polar product in the reaction mixture ).
The starting ketone for acenaphthacenone 6 , was easily prepared by conventional AlCl3 - catalyzed Friedel − Crafts acylation / alkylation of naph- thacene with chloroacetyl chloride.
Our treatment of 6 with TiCl4 in reﬂuxing ODCB obviously gave some trimer 4 , which appeared as a deep blue band on TLC , but the apparent instability of compound 4 to air and light made isolation diﬃcult.
Using this method , the formation of diverse 2-(alkynyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3- arylamines 3 has been previously described , along with their cyclization under basic conditions to obtain original substituted pyrido[2′,1′:2,3]-imidazo[4,5-b]quinolones 4.10 We report herein the formation of 2-(alkynyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3- alkylamines 5 followed by an iodine - catalyzed intramolecular cyclization.
recently reported a Sonogashira reaction on pyridylethynyltrimethylsilyl deriva- tives.12 Their experimental conditions were attempted on our substrate , and we were pleased to isolate 5q and 5r in good yield ( Scheme 4 ).
in a mixture of dioxane / MeOH ( 2 / 1 ) , a fast and complete dehalogenation was observed under microwave irradiation , and 9 was isolated in 85 % yield .
( 2a ; 2.0 equiv ) in the presence of CuI ( 20 mol % ) in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) at 100 ° C for 12 h , and to our delight the desired vinyl sulfone 3a was harvested in 45 % yield as shown in Table 1 ( entry 1 ).
Subsequently , various copper salts such as cupric oxide , cuprous bromide , and copper acrylate were tested as the catalysts , copper acrylate was proved to be the best choice , and the target product 3a was selectively achieved in 60 % yield with an E conﬁguration ( entries 2 − 7 , Table 1 and SI ).
Furthermore , the reaction was ·4H2O ( 15 mol % ) promoted with increased amount of FeCl2 and the oxidant DTBP ( 3.0 equiv ) , aﬀording 3a in 81 % yield.
Interestingly , the vinyl sulfone product 3a was isolated again in 75 % yield ( Table 3 ).
After 12 h reactions at 100 ° C , however , only a trace amount of product 3a was detected in both cases , and the starting materials were recycled , indicating that the reactions were almost completely inhibited by TEMPO ( 4 equiv ).
radical D could be readily accessed with the release of molecular nitrogen.8 Next , the addition of radical D to an active cuprate complex E,9 which is generated by the reaction of copper acrylate and phenylpropiolic acid / phenylacetylene , would give an intermediate F.9 Then , the protonolysis of intermediate F with tert-butanol which was generated in the process of the oxidation of sulfonyl hydrazide resulted in the generation of G.10 Eventually , target product 3a is obtained from G with the participation of a proton produced from previous steps , by releasing the Cu(II) species to fullﬁll the catalytic cycle ( Scheme 2 ) .
ABSTRACT : N-Bromosuccinimide - mediated 4,6-O-benzylidene ring opening in 8-azido-3,6-dioxaoctyl 4,6-O-benzylidene-2-deoxy-2-trichloroacetamido-β-D- glucopyranoside aﬀorded the corresponding 4-O-benzoyl-6-bromo-6-deoxy analogue , which was coupled with 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-O-benzyl-α-D-galactopyr- anosyl chloride to give the 1,2-cis α-linked disaccharide as the major product.
The latter was sequentially deacetylated and selectively benzylated to give 8-azido-3,6-dioxaoctyl 2,4-di-O-benzyl-3,6-dideoxy-α-L-xylo-hexopyranosyl-(1→ 4)-[3-O-benzyl-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→3)]-6-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-2-trichloroacetamido-β-D-glucopyranoside.
Subsequent selec- tive phosphorylation of the triol , thus obtained , with 2,2,2-trichloroethyl phosphorodichloridate aﬀorded isomeric (R,S)-(P)- 4II,6II-cyclic phosphates , which were both obtained in crystalline form and fully characterized.
Zemplén de-O-acylation of 5α gave tetraol 6 in virtually quantitative yield , and subsequent isopropylidenation ( 2,2- dimethoxypropane and camphorsulfonic acid in DMF at 45 ° C ) gave selectively the 3II,4II-O-isopropylidene derivative 7.
To circumvent this issue , the aldehyde was ﬁrst converted to the corresponding N-tert-butyl imine.20 Treating this masked aldehyde with sodium cyclohexanoxide , followed by acidic hydrolysis , yielded 45 % of the desired product 13a over three steps ( Table 1 , entry 1 ) .
In our previous report examining controlled Ir - catalyzed ester hydrosilylation of esters ( 1 ) to aﬀord silyl acetals (2),18a,20 we found the formation of doubly reduced cyclic silyl ethers ( 5 ) as minor byproducts , which were only observed when arenes possessing electron - donating groups , such as an amino group or unprotected indole , were used ( Scheme 2 ).
conditions , doubly reduced silyl ether intermediates ( 5 ) were ﬁrst produced , which underwent subsequent C − H silylation to yield benzoxasiloles ( 6 ).
The more sterically congested ortho-substituted ketone 7j also gave desired product 8j with good yield.
Sterically hindered isopropyl ketone 7j was examined and yielded 8j in excellent yield.
Finally , cyclic ketone , 1- tetralone 7k provided tetrahydronaphthoxasilole 8k in 85 % yield.
, Me ) in 9a aﬀorded more hydrosilylation adduct 11a ( 10a:11a = 1.0 : 1.3 ).
directed dehydrogenative Csp3 When ester 12 was subjected to the catalytic reaction conditions , −H sequential Ir- and Rh - catalyzed exhaustive , reductive Csp3 silylation indeed aﬀorded benzoxasiline 13 in modest yield ( 36 % ) , primarily due to competitive alkene hydrosilylation between the primary alcohol - derived hydridosilyl ether and norbornene ( C − H silylation : hydrosilylation = 1 : 1.5 ).
Csp3 −H silylation of aldehyde 15 provided benzoxasiline 17 with modest yield ( 43 % ) , similar to those observed in esters , and Rh - catalyzed −H silylation of ketone 14 provided benzoxasiline reductive Csp3 16 with good yield ( 84 % ) through relatively fast cyclization of the ketone - derived silyl ether .
For example , the use of 1,10-phenanthroline gave 10H-phenothiazine in 70 % yield , whereas DABCO , bis-pyridyl and L-proline provided much lower yields of 11 % , 19 % and 14 % , respectively ( Table 1 , entries 12 − 15 ).
It is noteworthy that the intermediate product 4a was formed as a byproduct under the optimized conditions via the C − S cross-coupling reaction of N-(2-mercaptophenyl)acetamide ( 1a ) with 1,2-dibromobenzene.
Furthermore , the subsequent intramolecular C − N cross coupling of 4a gave the N-acetylated phenothiazine 5a.
Most of the 1,2-dihalobenzene substrates , including 1-bromo-2- chlorobenzene , 1-chloro-2-iodobenzene , 1,2-dibromobenzene , 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene , reacted smoothly with N-(5-chloro-2-mercaptophenyl)acetamide to give 2-chloro-10H-phenothiazine in yields of up to 92 % ( Table 2 , entries 10 − 14 ).
Key intermediate 9 and its C-6 epimer 11 were prepared by previously reported procedures.38 Reaction of 11 with diethylaminosulfur triﬂuoride ( DAST ) in the presence of pyridine was overall slow , and some intermediates clearly involving the Et2N group were detected by NMR character- ization.
Continuing stirring of the solution for several days resulted in conversion of the intermediates to ﬂuorinated oxazolidinone 14 in 39 % yield ﬁnally , together with some unidentiﬁed side products.
To determine its C-5 conﬁguration , 14 was hydrogenated under routine conditions to aﬀord debenzylated product 15 ( Scheme 2 ).
Because the NEt2 groups were found in the initial reaction intermediates of 11 and DAST , we tentatively assumed that DAST preferentially reacted with the primary hydroxyl group in 11 to furnish intermediate 16 ( Scheme 3 ).
On one hand , attack of ﬂuoride at the C-7 leaving group would aﬀord product 12 , which would continue to react with another equivalent of DAST to give intermediate 17.
Synthetic methods for this type of carbamate have been well - documented in the literature.57−61 Herein , the synthesis was based on our previously reported procedures ; 38,62 treatment of 9 with sodium hydride at room temperature provided oxazolidinone 19 and oxazinanone 22 in 82 % total yield ( Scheme 4 ).
By the same procedures , bicyclic derivatives 28 and 32 were obtained from 11 in 85 % total yield ( Scheme 5 ) .
Fluorination of oxazolidinones 19 and 28 aﬀorded compounds 14 and 29 , respectively , both in moderate yields.
Subsequent hydrogenolysis of the four oxazolidinones resulted in products 21 , 30 , 15 , and 31 , respectively ( Schemes 4 and 5 ).
While oxazinanones 22 and 32 were reacted with DAST , ﬂuorination gave anticipated products 23 and 33 together with elimination products 24 and 34 , respectively.
23 After signiﬁcant optimization , an eﬃcient two - step protocol involving condensation of amino acetonitrile 9 with DMF·DMA to give azadiene 10 , followed by an N- methylaniline - catalyzed addition of methylamine , prepared imidazole 11 in good overall yield and excellent purity.
accomplished using N-bromosuccinimide ( NBS ) in DMF , producing the C5 regioisomer 3 with > 90 : 10 ( C5 : C2 ) selectivity.
C5-Bromoimidazole 3 could be isolated as a single isomer by direct crystallization.25 With both coupling partners in hand , the Suzuki coupling of boronic ester 6 with C5- bromoimidazole 3 proceeded under standard conditions using Pd(OAc)2 / PPh3 , delivering the biaryl compound 7 without issue ( Scheme 1 ).
In order to test our proposed 6π-electrocyclization , we required the conversion of the nitrile in pyrrole 7 to the corresponding amidine 13 ( Scheme 4 ).
This lack of reactivity was circumvented by converting nitrile 7 to hydroxyamidine 12 ( by treatment with ethanolic NH2OH , Scheme 4 ) , followed by reduction under standard conditions ( Pd / C),27 providing the desired amidine 13 in excellent overall yield.
The desired product 14 and amidine 13 were formed along with a signiﬁcant amount of oxadiazole 15 ( formed through condensative self - cyclization of the O-acylated amidine , Scheme 6 , pathway b ).
In seeking to optimize this transformation , we quickly determined that hydrogen and O-acylation were critical ; control experiments showed that exposure of the hydrox- yamidine 12 to the reaction conditions resulted in quantitative conversion to the amidine 13.
that while the initial addition of bromine to crotononitrile was extremely slow , catalytic amounts of HBr could be employed to improve the reaction rate ; thus HBr was added to the bromination reaction providing good yields of dibromide 17.
The Sandmeyer reaction , converting aminopyrazole 18 to iodopyrazole 19 , occurred smoothly albeit in modest yield.35 With iodopyrazole 19 in hand , we focused on developing a copper - mediated Ullmann − Goldberg − Buchwald coupling ( Table 2 ).
With control over both of these parameters , smooth saponiﬁcation was observed , giving the Na salt 23 in high yield ( Scheme 9 ) .
) failed to cleanly convert acid 23 to amide 1.
However , reactions of the substrate 4 were sluggish and aﬀorded 2,3-dihydro-1,3-oxazin-4-one derivatives 5 in low yields under mild conditions.
After scrutiny of the reaction with 4 and 2a , 2,3-dihydro-1,3-oxazin-4-one 5a was formed in 27 % yield , along with bis-β-lactam 6a in 6 % yield ( eq 1 , Scheme 3 ).
In Pathway B , after elimination of HCl in 1 , the generated monoketene INT1 could undergo cyclization to deliver α- oxoketene , followed by [ 4 + 2 ] annulation with imine 2m to yield the 2,3-dihydro-1,3-oxazin-4-one derivative 3m.
This is in accord with the previous experimental result23 and is also supported by our experimental observation the reaction of 1,6-diazo-2,5-hexanedione ( 9 ) as the that bisketene precursor with imine 2a can not aﬀord oxazinone 3a ( eq 3 , Scheme 3 ) , while adipoyl dichloride ( 1 ) can.
By switching the solvent to the more polar acetonitrile , the reaction furnished 3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydroisoquinoline-1,4-dione ( the structure of which was unambiguously conﬁrmed through X-ray crystallo- graphic analysis ) as the major product in 10 % yield , with 80 % of the starting material recovered.
equiv of PIFA was used , the starting material 1a was completely consumed with the product 2a being obtained in 42 % yield.
As expected , the reaction of 1u yielded a mixture of compounds 2 and 3 in a ratio of 3 : 1 .
By switching the oxidant to the less potent PIDA , A was converted to N′-benzoyl-N,N′-dimethoxybenzohy- drazide B14 and N-acetoxy-N-methoxybenzamide C , in 70 % and 20 % of the total yield , respectively15 ( Scheme 1a ).
Reaction between D and PIFA under our standard conditions yielded an oxazole derivative E,16 instead of a diketone F as we had expected based on the report that 1,2-diphenylethyne derivatives could be converted into diketones under Vasil’eva ’s conditions ( Scheme 1b ).
In path a , the N-methoxyamide moiety , as the nucleophile , reacts with PIFA and gave intermediate H , accompanied by the loss of one molecule of triﬂuoroacetic acid.20 Then an intramolecular cyclization occurs
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The dialdehyde 1 reacts smoothly with the C − H - active compounds A − H in the presence of a base to give the Knoevenagel adducts 2a − h in yields ranging from 37 to 85 % after workup and puriﬁcation.
With 20 mol % of Cu(I)Br as the catalyst at reﬂuxing temperature in the air , the reaction proceeded to yield 6-methyl phenanthridine 3a and the amide derivative 2 as a separable mixture ( eq 1 ).
Reaction of 2-(o- methylphenyl)benzenediazonium tetraﬂuoroborate 4 with various nitrile yielded 6,10-substituted phenanthridines 8a−8d in good isolated yields , whereas 2-(p-methoxyphenyl)- benzenediazonium tetraﬂuoroborate 5 gave 6,8-substituted phenanthridines 9a−9d in good yields.
The ﬂuoro - substituted substrate , 2-(p-ﬂuorophenyl)benzenediazonium tetraﬂuorobo- rate 6 , reacted with benzonitrile and acetonitrile to give 8- ﬂuorophenanthridines 9e ( 43 % ) and 9f ( 58 % ) , respectively .
For the meta analogue 11 , the diazonium coupling reaction took place directly , instead of the nucleophilic attack by the nitrile , to give benzo[c]cinnoline in 85 % yield , presumably due to the double activation of the substituents ( Scheme 2b ).
Suzuki - coupling of 2- bromo-p-toluidine with p-methoxyphenyl-boronic acid gave the desired biarylamine 15.
Diazotization of 15 yielded the diazonium salt 16 , which was heated in acetonitrile to give 17 in 86 % yield .
When the temperature was increased to 80 ° C , C − N bond formation readily took place to provide isatin 2a in moderate yield along with a trace amount of iodoisatin 3a ( Table 1 , entry 2 ).
Increasing the amount of I2 ( 1.0 equiv ) led to the formation of a mixture of 2a and 3a ( Table 1 , entry 3 ).
When 2.0 equiv of I2 was used , iodoisatin 3a was obtained as an exclusive product in good yield ( Table 1 , entry 8 ) .
The electron - donating methyl group bearing aromatic ring 1c increased the rate of the reaction to provide isatin 2c in excellent yield.
However , the inductively electron- withdrawing -F or -Cl substituent bearing phenylacetylenes 1d and 1e decreased the rate of the reaction and corresponding isatins 2d and 2e , respectively , were obtained in good yields.
Intriguingly , 2′-aminopyridyl acetylene 1f containing a highly deactivated aromatic ring provided pyrrolopyridine-2,3-dione 2f in good yield.
Contrary to the failure met with the CuI / bipy system,6a the present method remarkably accom- plished the conversion of N-ethyl acetate - substituted 2′- aminostyrene 4m to isatin 2m in good yield.
Similarly , 2′-N-(2-bromoethyl)-aminostyrene 4n produced isatin 2n in good yield.
2′-N,N-Dialkylamine - substituted styrenes 4i , 4k , 4q , and 4r underwent tandem demethylation and cyclization to produce the corresponding isatins 2i , 2k , 2q , and 2r in good to excellent yield.
Unsubstituted 2′-aminostyrene 4g resulted in isatin 2g in less yield.
Similar to earlier observations , N-acetyl 2′-aminostyrene 4h produced isatin 2g instead of the expected isatin 2h , albeit in low yield.
Signiﬁcantly , with a stoichiometric amount of I2 , compound 4a produced iodoisatin 3a in good yield.
The reaction of 5a with 0.5 equiv of I2 in DMSO at 100 ° C furnished isatin 2i in 66 % isolated yield via N-demethylation18c and the Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation process.19 To the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst time a Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation was observed in the presence of molecular iodine.
Further , to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the present method , we converted compound 1a to isatin 2a under optimal condition and subsequently treated 2a with thiosemicarbazide ( 8 ) to get antiviral agent drug metisazone ( 9 ) in high yield in one pot ( Scheme 5 ).
Substrates 1 and 4 on iodination give α- iodoketone A,16,17 which can readily be converted to phenylglyoxal B by Kornblum oxidation in the presence of DMSO.21 Further activation of the formyl group of phenyl- glyoxal B by Lewis acidic I2 (C)22 facilitates nucleophilic addition of the ortho amine group to form secondary alcohol D.
Substrate 5 initially underwent cyclization to give oxindole salt , which further loses its methyl group by highly nucleophilic iodide ions to generate oxindole E.18c Next , oxindole E underwent Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation to give secondary alcohol D.19 Secondary alcohol D then underwent self- oxidation to provide isatin 2.
To our surprise , oxidation of benzene-1,2-diamine under the present conditions selectively gave 2-nitroaniline as a product ( Scheme 2 ).
the reaction with 2- aminophenol gave 2-nitrophenol as a product ( Table 2 , entry 3s ).
This assumption was further conﬁrmed from the reaction of 2-aminophenol and 2-methoxyaniline , as the former was oxidized to 2-nitrophenol whereas 2-methoxyaniline failed to undergo any oxidation reaction under the present conditions.
Further validation of this assumption was done by carrying out reactions with N-(2- aminophenyl)acetamide and 4-chloro-N1-phenylbenzene-1,2- diamine to give 4m ( 87 % ) and 4n ( 90 % ) , respectively , in 20 min ( Table 3 , entries 4m and 4n ) .
Oxidation of 2,6-dichloro-p-phenylenediamine gives 92 % yield of dichloran in 20 min ( Table 3 , entry 4e ).
The reaction of benzene-1,4- diamine with 6 equiv of peroxy acid gave 1,4-dinitrobenzene ( Table 3 , entry 4i ) , but in the case of benzene-1,3-diamine , a polar spot was observed on TLC instead of 1,3-dinitrobenzene .
The use of a palladium(II)- catalyzed Overman rearrangement was next investigated , and while this transformation was conducted under mild conditions , 2,5-dihydro-1-benzoxepine 11a was isolated in only 26 % yield ( entry 3 ).
24 After 20 h , complete conversion could be achieved using a 5 mol % catalyst loading , resulting in the isolation of 2,5-dihydro-1-benzoxepine 11a in 68 % yield from allylic alcohol 8a .
coupling of 4-ﬂuorophenylboronic acid ( 12 ) and methyl 2- hydroxy-4-iodobenzoate ( 13 ) gave biaryl compound 14 in quantitative yield.
Reduction of the ester with lithium aluminum hydride and selective allylation of the phenol gave benzyl alcohol 15.
This was then subjected to a one - pot Swern oxidation and HWE reaction , which gave (E)-α,β-unsaturated ester 16 as the sole product in 84 % yield over the two steps .
Standard hydro- genation conditions ( 10 % Pd / C in an atmosphere of H2 ) gave 19 in 59 % yield.
25 This produced 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-benzoxepine 19 more cleanly in 81 % yield .
A synthesis of 8-chloro-5-guanidino-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1- benzoxepine ( 4 ) , a known hypotensive agent was developed from 2,5-dihydro-1-benzoxepine 11i ( Scheme 5 ).
Hydrogenation of 11i under standard conditions resulted in reduction of both the alkene and the trichloromethyl group giving 21 as the sole product in 94 % yield.
This was coupled with commercially available N,N′-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1H-pyra- zole-1-carboxamidine ( 22 ) in the presence of Hünig ’s base , and this gave guanidine 23 in 75 % yield over the two steps.26,27 Finally , removal of the Boc-protecting groups using TFA completed the 10-step synthesis of hypotensive agent 4 in 40 % overall yield from commercially available 4-chloro-2-hydrox- ybenzaldehyde ( 5i ) .
Reaction of 6-methoxy-2,5-dihydro-1-benzoxepine 11b with osmium tetroxide and TMEDA under Donohoe conditions gave the corresponding (3R*,4S*,5S*)-diol 24 in 74 % yield ( Scheme 6 ).
Again NOE experiments conﬁrmed the all syn-diastereomer 25 as the major product , formed via a substrate - directed process that is in agreement with Henbest ’s rule.30,31 Without puriﬁcation , regioselective hydrolysis of epoxide 25 under acidic conditions gave after puriﬁcation , the (3S*,4S*,5S*)-diol 26 in good yield over the two steps.
As reported previously,9 initial investigations into the reaction between the dienyl boronate 1 and nitrosobenzene 2 resulted in the formation of the unexpected N-phenylpyrrole 3a instead of a mixture of regioisomeric oxazine cycloadducts ( Scheme 2 ).
Indeed , even when the reaction was followed by 1H NMR , only 3-methyl-1-phenyl-pyrrole 3a , together with some azoxybenzene 4 , was identiﬁed.
There was a notable absence of any oxazine cycloadducts , and the re- action was complete after 5 h to aﬀord 3a in 82 % isolated yield ( Table 1 , entry 3 ) .
Diﬀerently substituted nitrosoarene compounds were reacted with borodiene 1 to aﬀord N-arylpyrroles 3 in moderate to good yields.
Unsubstituted 1-borobutadiene 5 reacted eﬃciently with nitrosobenzene to give the corresponding pyrrole 3h in 78 % yield ( entry 1 , Table 2 ).
trimethylsilylacetylene , followed by proto - desilylation , to give 4-phenyl-3-buten-1-yne as an E / Z mixture ( 91 / 9 ).
12 Hydro- boration using pinacolborane and Schwartz ’s catalyst11a provided the desired diene 8 as a mixture of two stereo- isomers ( E,E : E,Z = 91 : 9 ) in a 56 % overall yield.
Finally , the use of 3.5 equiv of nitrosobenzene ( entry 8 , Table 3 ) was required in order to achieve the complete conversion of both stereoisomers of diene 8 , resulting in the formation of pyrrole 3k and a 36 % isolated yield .
Nevertheless , 26 % of the corresponding pyrrole 3l was isolated after silica gel chro- matography ( entry 5 , Table 4 ) .
Reaction of 1-borodiene 10 with nitrosobenzene resulted in the identiﬁcation of the [ 4 + 2]-cycloadduct 11 in the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude mixture.14 After 2 h , all the diene 10 was consumed and the intermediate boro-1,2-oxazine 11 had also disappeared , to- gether with small amounts of azoxybenzene 4 ( Scheme 3 ).
this increased reactivity was conﬁrmed by the reaction of cyclic diene 12,16 which provided pyrrole 3i after only 2 h and in a 46 % yield , as shown in eq 1 ( compared with
However , single regioisomeric products were obtained , as exempliﬁed by the formation of the stable [ 4 + 2]-cycloadduct 14a , obtained from reaction of diene 13 with nitrosobenzene and isolated in 64 % yield ( entry 1 , Table 5 ).
Moreover , the byproduct 36 was isolated by extracting the reaction mixture with DCM ( see Scheme 6 ) in 25 % yield , whose structure was established by 1H , 13C , and 11B NMR , and mass spectroscopy.
Under classical experimental conditions for this class of reaction , 1H NMR of the crude reaction mixture ( see the Supporting Information ) shows a full conversion of the starting material into the pyrrole 3a that showed that 14a is not stable enough to survive under Suzuki − Miyaura coupling conditions ( Scheme 7 ).
To conﬁrm that this is indeed the location of the boronated group that is responsible for this failure , the diene 37 was synthesized from (1-bromovinyl)-MIDA boronate and 1-bromostyrene.21 The reaction with nitrosobenzene regiose- lectively provided the cycloadduct 38 in a 73 % isolated yield the second isomer.22 To conﬁrm the with only traces of structure of the major regioisomer , it was engaged in a Suzuki− Miyaura cross-coupling with 1-bromotoluene in the presence of palladium acetate and SPhos ( Scheme 8 ).
The key desymmetrized annulation diphenol intermediates 3a − c were readily prepared from prochiral 2,2,6,6-tetrahydroxy-biphenyl with diﬀerent chiral bis(mesylate) or bis(tosylate) by a Williamson synthesis.13 Following a SN2 substitution reaction mechanism , the central chirality conﬁg- uration of the ether - linked backbone became reversed from 2.
The dimethylamine - derived phosphoramidite ligand (S,S,Ra)- 4e was prepared via another reaction of (S,S,Ra)-3b with hexamethylphosphorus triamide.1 Through a single - crystal X- ray diﬀraction analysis of ligand (S,S,Ra,S,S)-4a , all its chiral conﬁgurations were conﬁrmed ( Figure 1 ).
Furthermore , α,β- unsaturated aldehydes with alkenyl or alkyl substituents , such as styryl or methyl , also reacted smoothly with 1a to aﬀord corresponding products 4k and 4l in acceptable results ( entry 10 and 11 ).
The conﬁgurations the other derivatives were assigned by analogy.12 For of oxindole substrates 1j and 1k bearing the same substituent but at diﬀerent positions , it was observed that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in their transformation to products 4u and 4v ( entries 9 and 10 , respectively ) .
It was observed that Pd - catalyzed hydrogenation in methanol at room temperature could deliver corresponding spirocyclic oxindole 5 in 46 % isolated yield without loss of ee and slightly higher diastereoselectivity .
With regard to the mechanism , we assume that the reaction of the (S)-diphenylprolinol-TMS ether catalyst 3a with α,β- unsaturated aldehydes 2 results in intermediary iminimu ion A ( Scheme 3 ).
Subsequently , inter- mediate A with 3-pyrrolyl-oxindoles 1 gives rise to another intermediate B , which , after hydrolysis , yields adduct C and releases catalyst 3a.
Finally , under acidic reaction conditions , intermediate 4′ is dehydrated to generate spirocyclic oxindole 4 bearing a 5,6-dihydropyrido[1,2-a]pyrrole ring system ( Scheme 3 ) .
Despite the presence of the unprotected C3 hydroxyl group in 2a , pretreatment with 1 equiv of Me3Al or i- Bu2AlH to form alkoxy(dialkyl)alanes 2b allowed eﬃcient phenylation giving 3a in high yield with 1 equiv of Ph3Al.
in PhMe followed by a MeOH quench and column overnight chromatography , a 34 % yield of arylglucoside β-3d was obtained , along with 4 % of disaccharide 714 and 23 % unreacted 1,6-anhydroglucose ( Table 2 , entry 1 ).
Pleasingly , heating 10 and 6 equiv of Ph3Al ( 1.0 M in n-Bu2O ) in dioxane ( Table 3 , entry 1 ) produced over a 66 h period a 73 % HPLC yield of 1-C-phenyl- β-D-glucoside ( β-3d ) , along with 1.8 % of the α-anomer α-3d , providing proof of concept.
In fact a 65 % HPLC yield was achieved along with only trace amounts of the isobutylated derivative 9 when the arylation was performed at 140 ° C for 48 h ( entry 8 ).
After 18 h reaction 61 % 1a and 33 % unreacted 10 were witnessed by calibrated HPLC ( using internal standards ) ; however , no further 1a was formed after another 2 h , and following aqueous workup and column chromatography a 50 % isolated yield of 97.7 % -pure canagliﬂozin was obtained .
Our attention was captured by reports from Madsen and co-workers that 1,2-cyclopropanated sugars gave C2 - substituted glycosides 2 when reacted with alcohols in the presence of Zeise ’s dimer , [Pt(C2H4)Cl2]2 ( 3 ) ( Figure 2 ).
On the basis of these Madsen results , we postulated that oxaspirohexanes 4 could be converted to psico - nucleosides 5 ( Figure 3 , for Nu = nucleobase ) with Zeise ’s dimer insertion into the cyclopropane providing an alternative access to oxetane oxocarbenium ions .
Unexpectedly , under the Madsen conditions,4 oxaspirohex- ane 4a ( or 4b ) gave mixtures of two products , 3- methylenetetrahydrofuran 6a ( or 6b ) and allyl ether 7a ( or 7b ) ( Table 1 ).
Moreover , in the absence of MeOH , 4a was converted to just 3-methylenetetrahydrofuran 6a , while allyl ether 7a was the sole isolable product in the presence of excess MeOH.
Evaluation of solvents for the reaction showed that noncoordinating solvents , such as methylene chloride , chloroform , and toluene , gave clean conversion of oxaspirohexane 4a to 3-methylenetetrahydrofuran 6a at concentrations from 0.2 to 1.0 M.
Unexpectedly , when 5,6-cis - substituted oxaspirohexane 4l was reacted under the standard conditions , ring - opened allyl chloride 11 was isolated as the major product ( Scheme 1 ).
When 5,6-cis - substituted oxaspirohexane 4k was used , ring- opened alcohol 12 was obtained in 42 % yield.
This process , a variant of which was reported during the preparation of this manuscript by Kuwahara et al.,18 gives acetal 15 in 65 % yield after crystallization.
Acetal 15 did not require any speciﬁc deprotection and underwent reduction with sodium borohydride to give diol 16 as a single stereoisomer in 87 % yield.
We found that conversion of 13 to epoxide 12 could be achieved using a modiﬁed one - pot tosylation / substitution procedure giving 12 in 93 % yield.19 Full character- ization ( including single - crystal X-ray analysis ) veriﬁed the structure and stereochemistry of 12.
Hydride reduction at the epoxide terminus and mesylation of the resulting secondary alcohol proceeded smoothly , giving 11 in 84 % yield over two steps .
Vorbrüggen glycosidation using typical conditions gave 20 and 22 with excellent selectivity at the 1′-position ( > 95 : 5 anomeric ratio ) as determined by HPLC.20 Solvolysis of the 2′-OAc groups in 20 and 22 and subsequent cyclization proved to be straightforward using typical conditions.2,6 Following amide formation for the purine series ( 23 → 24 ) , the ﬁnal proof of the synthetic approach was demonstrated successfully.
Conversion of 21 to 1a was achieved using Pd(OH)2 supported on carbon ( Evonik E101 ) under hydrogen at 60 psig.16 The same conditions did not give complete conversion of 24 to 1b , and a transfer hydrogenation using the same catalyst and ammonium formate in 2-propanol was used.21 From mesylate 11 , pyrimidine 1a was generated in 60 % yield over four steps ; purine analogue 1b ( which comprises an extra amide - forming step ) was generated in 38 % yield over ﬁve steps .
method employs the enzymes O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydra- lase 2 ( OAH2 ) , betaine homocysteine methyltransferase ( BHMT ) , and SAMsyn to convert inorganic sulﬁde ( S2− ) to L-homocysteine ( HCys 4 ) , Met 2 , and ultimately SAM 1 ( Scheme 1 ) .
With equal concentrations of Na2S and 3 we observed the formation of 4 along with a signiﬁcant amount of the side product 5.
19 Incubating 4 and 4 equiv of betaine with BHMT in the presence of 1 mM DTT gave a near quantitative yield of 2.
Steric hindrance was clearly detrimental in the reaction , as observed using o-tolyl cyanamide ( 14d ) and o-tolylboronic acid ( 13c ) to assemble benzimidazole 1l , isolated in 36 % yield.
Indeed , we were able to isolate from the reaction a side product resulting from a Csp3-H activation / cyclization process,24 namely 2-amino-1-phenylquinazolin-4(1H)-one 15 , albeit in a low 15 % yield .
9 Its condensation with benzoic acid in the presence of polyphos- phoric acid ( PPA ) yielded intermediate 6,4 which was then doubly brominated on the central benzene ring with N- bromosuccinimide ( NBS ) to produce compound 7.
Cruciform 4l was obtained after acidic hydrolysis of the tetrahydropyranyl ( THP ) protecting group in 4k .
inherently selective method for the formation of mono- or disubstituted derivatives ; indeed , the Ni(PPh3)2(1-naphthyl)Cl- catalyzed amination reported by Song aﬀorded the product 2- bromo-7-(N,N-diphenylamino) in only 10 % yield relative to the 2,7-dibromopyrene starting material.14 Therefore , due to the potential wide utility of the products , we were motivated to develop a protocol that was both more general and selective.
Following our reported5 selective monoborylation of pyrene to aﬀord 2-(Bpin)pyrene and conversion of this compound to 2-bromopyrene in high isolated yield,2 a copper- mediated amination with diethylamine and stoichiometric CuI was attempted ; however , no reaction had occurred after 4 days at 80 ° C in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.
Instead , 1 was synthesized by Buchwald - Hartwig amination using the precatalyst Pd2(dba)3 ( 0.3 mol % ; dba = dibenzylideneacetone ) , the phosphine ligand SPhos ( 1 mol % ; SPhos = 2-dicyclohex- ylphosphino-2′,6′-dimethoxybiphenyl ) and NaOtBu base.
Direct ipso cyanation of 2-(Bpin)pyrene was performed using an adaptation of the method developed by Hartwig and co-workers,25 aﬀording 2- cyanopyrene ( 2 ) in a yield of 45 % .
Ir - catalyzed C − H borylation of 2-bromopyrene gave 2-Bpin-7-bromopyrene ( 4 ) in 52 % yield.
Triarylformazans 8a − d , 3-cyanoformazans 8e,f , and 3-nitroformazans 8g,h were synthesized by adapting previously published protocols.16 Formazanate BF2 complexes 7a − h were prepared by reﬂuxing the parent formazans in toluene in the presence of excess triethylamine and boron triﬂuoride diethyl etherate ( Scheme 1 and Table 1 ).
Starting from B21C7 derivative 8 with a terminal hydroxyl group , treatment of 8 with PBr3 can aﬀord an unstable intermediate B21C7 - containing benzyl bromide , which was directly converted into azide- functionalized B21C7 macrocycle 7 in the presence of sodium azide in 58 % two - step total yield.
Furthermore , the self - assembling [2]pseudorotaxane could be formed when 7 and 6 were mixed and dissolved simultaneously in the less polar solvent CH2Cl2 , which was subsequently converted into [2]rotaxane 2 with an azide group in B21C7 macrocycle in a relatively high yield ( 88 % ) through the esteriﬁcation reaction with benzoic anhydride using tributylphosphine [P(n-Bu)3] as the catalyst.
Finally , DB24C8 5 and dibenzylammonium 4 with two alkyne groups were mixed and dissolved in CH2Cl2 , and subsequently the well- known copper(I) - catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction with azide - functionalized [2]rotaxane 2 led to formation of the target hetero[4]rotaxane 1 in 55 % yield .
and DB24C8 in CH2Cl2 solution can form the self - assembling [2]pseudorotaxane , which can further react with B21C7 derivative 7 in the presence of [Cu(CH3CN)4PF6] as the catalyst to get a new [2]rotaxane 3 , with one DB24C8 ring encircled on the dibenzylammonium station and the other two B21C7 rings situated at each side of the structure , in 72 % yield.
This self - complexing [n]pseudorotaxane should be converted into the target hetero[4]rotaxane 1 in moderate yield ( 54 % ) through the esteriﬁcation reaction with benzoic anhydride under the condition of [P(n-Bu)3] as the catalyst.
With slight modiﬁca- tion of the standard reaction conditions , we could obtain the coupling product 9a in 80 % yield ( Scheme 5 ).
In the course of the structural elucidation , Wu2 described the O - methylation of 1 to provide O-methylmurrayamine A ( 2 ) , which was isolated as a natural product in 2003 by Nakatani and co- workers4 from the leaves of M.
naphthyl ( rac - BINAP ) , provided the diarylamine 11 almost quantitatively.
Microwave heating of 11 in the presence of catalytic amounts of palladium(II) acetate and copper(II) acetate as reoxidant led to the protected carbazole 12.
The desired annulation precursor 13 was ﬁnally obtained by hydrogenolytic cleavage of the benzyl ether .
Various methods have been developed for the annulation of pyran rings to hydroxyarenes , notably those described by the groups of Iwai and Ide , Godfrey , Casiraghi , and Dufresne.14 Treatment of hydroxycarbazole 13 with prenal ( 14 ) , propionic acid , and catalytic amounts of phenylboronic acid in toluene at reﬂux provided the pyrano[3,2-a]carbazole 15 ( Scheme 2 ).
15 Subsequent cleavage of the silyl ether with tetra-n-butylammo- nium ﬂuoride ( TBAF ) transformed 15 into murrayamine A ( 1 ) , which was obtained in ﬁve steps and 46 % overall yield based on the protected 3-bromophenol 9.
Phenylboronic acid - catalyzed reaction of the 2-hydroxycarba- zole 13 and citral ( 16 ) in toluene provided the silyl-protected mahanine 17 in 75 % yield.15 The transformation of 2-hydroxy- 3-methylcarbazole into cyclomahanimbine , which corresponds to the transformation of 13 into 17 , is known to proceed only in moderate yield with citral in pyridine ( 35 % ).
16 Cleavage of the silyl ether provided mahanine ( 3 ) in ﬁve steps and 56 % overall yield based on the protected 3-bromophenol 9.
Methyl ether formation by treatment of 3 with sodium hydride and iodide aﬀorded O-methylmahanine ( 4 ).
Treatment of 17 with 0.5 equiv of triﬂuoroacetic acid ( TFA ) in toluene led to the triisopropylsilyl (TIPS)-protected murraya- mine D 18 in 80 % yield.
Cleavage of the silyl ether with TBAF provided murrayamine D ( 5 ).
15 On the other hand , cyclization in the presence of 5 mol % camphorsulfonic acid ( CSA ) in n- hexane aﬀorded , after ﬂash chromatography , a mixture of 18 and the silyl-protected murrayamine E 19 in a ratio of 1 : 2.38 ( 94 % yield ).
cleavage of the silyl ether , isomers 5 and 6 could be separated and pure murrayamine E ( 6 ) was obtained in 54 % yield based on 17.
On the basis of our previous studies,10 it can be assumed that the proton - catalyzed isomerization of 17 rapidly leads to 19 , accompanied by a slow direct formation of 18.
In a further proton - catalyzed isomeri- zation , 19 is then converted to 18.
Treatment of prenal ( 14 ) with chlorotrimethylsilane and triethylamine in the presence of zinc chloride provided the silyl dienolate 20.20 Oxidation of 20 with stoichiometric amounts of palladium(II) acetate in the presence of sodium acetate aﬀorded 4-acetoxyprenal ( 21 ).
This mixture was immediately treated with methanolic potassium carbonate to provide exclusively 23.
Esteriﬁcation of 23 with acetic anhydride aﬀorded murrayamine K ( 8 ) in ﬁve steps and 42 % overall yield .
Reaction of acetoxyprenal ( 21 ) in the presence of titanium(IV) isoprop- oxide aﬀorded a mixture of the silyl-protected murrayamine I 24 and the corresponding deacetyl derivative 25 in only low yield.
ref 15 ) provided selectively the silyl-protected murrayamine I 24.
As the bioactivation of 2 is mediated by various cytochrome P450 enzymes , it was hypothesized that treatment of 2 with puriﬁed liver microsomes might accomplish the conversion of 2 to the active metabolite mixture 3.
Therefore , tetrahydropyridine 15 was prepared in enantioselective fashion from the commercially available arylglycine ester 17 via alkylation of the amine with homoallyl iodide and allyl bromide sequentially.
With resulting diene in hand , tetrahydropyridine 15 was prepared in 95 : 5 er and 17 % overall yield via ring - closing metathesis employing the Hoveyda − Grubbs second - generation ruthenium catalyst.15 Despite the poor overall yield , both of these protocols were readily scalable and enabled the preparation of multigram quantities of intermediate 15 .
Attempts to prepare analytical standards by trapping the crude sodium thiolate with MP-Br produced only the tetrahydropyridine 11.
Cyclopentanone 27 was prepared from D-ribose ( 28 ) , starting with concomitant protection of the C-2 / C-3 diol as the acetonide and formation of the methyl glycoside ( Scheme 11 ).
Treatment of 29 with lithiated dimethyl methylphosphonate produced enone 30 via nucleophilic ring - opening of the lactone followed by an intramolecular Horner − Wadsworth − Emmons reaction.18 Attempts to eﬀect a one - pot , tandem conjugate reduction / oxidation of enone 30 failed to produce any of the desired α-hydroxy cyclopentanone 31.
Alternatively , hydro- genation of enone 30 using Pd / C furnished cyclopentanone 27 in 98 % yield.
Horner− Wadsworth − Emmons oleﬁnation of ketone 27 yielded enoates 32 as an inseparable 1 : 1 mixture of E- and Z-isomers.
Treatment of this mixture with selenium dioxide produced allylic alcohols 34 and 35 which were readily separable by silica gel chromatography , thus providing stereodeﬁned access to both the C-3 enoate and a progenitor to the C-4 thiol.
the mesylate on E- and Z - isomers with thioacetic acid produced the thioacetates 40 and 41 , respectively , which could in turn be deprotected to thioacetates 21 and 23 and from there to metabolites 3 according to the conditions previously described ( Scheme 8 ).
Interestingly , while the E-isomer 41 was formed cleanly , the Z - isomer 40 was contaminated with SN2′ product 44 and a minor quantity of the C-4 epimer 45.
Alternatively , but higher in energy , is the conversion of nitrooxide A to trioxazetidine B , which is the trioxazetidine to nitrosamine and oxygen .
Synthesis of o-iododiaryl ether was achieved in one pot through sequential iodination and O-arylation of phenol under mild reaction conditions .
In fact , utilizing 4-nitrophenol ( 1a ) as the substrate in the presence of 1.5 equiv of phenyliodine diacetate ( PIDA ) in acetic acid under reﬂux leads to the formation of 1-(2-iodo-4-nitrophenoxy)benzene ( 3a ) in quantitative yield.
However , when 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde was treated with PIDA , under similar reaction conditions , 3- iodo-4-phenoxybenzaldehyde ( 3b ) was obtained , albeit in poor yield ( 30 % ).
We observed that when the reaction was carried out with PIDA in the presence of 5 equiv of acetic acid in dichloroethane at 80 ° C , 3b was obtained in 45 % yield.
Thus , the optimum yield of 3b was obtained when 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde was treated with 1.5 equiv of PIDA and 5 equiv of pivalic acid in dichloroethane at 80 ° C for 12 h.
Unlike Steven ’s work18a when 1a was treated with PIDA and acetic acid in dichloroethane at room temperature for 3 days , partial conversion occurs with the formation 3a ( 40 % yield ) and no trace of i.e.
nitrophenol was treated with substituted aryl diacetates ( Ar = 4-chlorophenyl and 4-methylphenyl ) under optimized reaction conditions , the corresponding o-iododiaryl ethers 3q and 3r were produced in appreciable yield .
When 5 mol % of palladium acetate was used , the intramolecular cyclization as well as hydrodehalogenation occurs and a mixture of dibenzofuran ( 6c ) and hydro- dehalogenated product ( 7 ) was produced ( 9 : 1 mixture from 1H NMR ).
We observed that PdCl2 and Pd(PPh3)4 also produced the dibenzofuran 6c in DMA in the presence of 3 equiv of K2CO3 ( ∼ 90 % yield ) along with the inseparable byproduct 7 ( from GC analysis ).
(thiophen-2-yl)ethylamine proceeded smoothly and produced the desired pyridines 2ag and 2ah in excellent yields ( 92 % and 90 % , respectively ).
with 2 equiv of electrophiles ( TMSCl and benzaldehyde ) under the standard reaction conditions , the desired product 2aa was not detected ( eq 2 ).
When N-propenyl enaminone 6 , prepared from base - promoted alkene isomerization of N-allyl enaminone 5,16 was treated under the standard conditions for 12 h ( eq 3 ) , the desired pyridine product 7 was obtained in 75 % yield.
We began our studies by exploring the reaction of thiophenol ( 1a ) with tert-butyl 2-(but-3-yn-1-yloxy) acetate ( 2a ) in DMF at 25 ° C ; however , alkenyl sulﬁde 3a was obtained as the sole product ( Table 1 , entry 1 ).
Reactions involving 5-hydroxypentyne ( 2o ) and 4-hydroxybutyne ( 2p ) also gave alkenylsuﬁdes 3o and 3p as the sole products in 77 % and 17 % yield , respectively ( Table 2 , entries 15 and 16 ).
In the reaction of 4-methylbenzene- thiol ( 1b ) with terminal alkyne 2a , α-thioaldehyde ( 4ba ) was obtained as the major product in 59 % yield and alkenylsulﬁde ( 3ba ) as minor product in 32 % yield ( Table 3 , entry 1 ).
On the contrary , the reaction of 2-methylbenzenethiol ( 1c ) gave the alkenylsulﬁde ( 3ca ) as major product in 70 % yield and α- thioaldehyde ( 4ca ) as minor product in 23 % yield ( Table 3 , entry 2 ).
In addition , the reaction of 2,6-dimethylbenzenethiol ( 1d ) with 2a gave alkenylsulﬁde ( 3da ) as sole product in 84 % yield ( Table 3 , entry 3 ).
An experiment using deuterium- labeled thiophenol ( 1a′ ) with n-hexyne ( 2b ) was carried out and the unlabeled α-thioaldehyde ( 4b ) was isolated as the product ( Scheme 1 , eq 1 ).
However , the reaction of thiophenol ( 1a ) with deuterium - labeled n-hexyne ( 2b′ ) gave the deuterated α- thioaldehyde ( 4b′ ) ( Scheme 1 , eq 2 ) , thus indicating that the aldehydic proton originated from n-hexyne ( 2b ).
To know if the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway , the reaction of tert-butyl 2-(but-3-yn-1-yloxy) acetate ( 2a ) with thiophenol ( 1a ) was carried out in the presence of the radical inhibitor , TEMPO ( 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy ) ( 5 ) , and only 2,2,6,6- tetramethyl-1-((phenylthio)oxy)piperidine ( 6 ) and diphenyl disulﬁde ( 7 ) were isolated , with no detectable sign of α- thioaldehyde ( 4a ).
The thiophenyl radical 8 initiated by TBHP coordinates with terminal alkyne 2a to form ﬂexible radical 9 , followed by addition of H2O to give radical 10 which then reacts with O2 ( air ) to give peroxy radical 11 ; this decomposes to form α-thioaldehyde 4a and hydroperoxy radical
30b,32 The o- quinone methide 5 is generated by treatment of 1 with base.
Methylation of the hydroxyl group in 2 under Mitsunobu conditions ( MeOH , diethyl azodicarboxylate ( DEAD ) , PPh3 , and THF ) readily gave 4 ( Scheme 4 ).
Powdered 4 was irradiated for 45 min with a 500 W xenon lamp , using a glass slide to cut oﬀ wavelengths below 420 nm , giving 7 in 93 % yield as the sole product.
Treatment of 1 with 2.0 equiv of 1-ethylpiperidine in THF gave 2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran ( 2 ) in 48 % yield ( entry 1 ).
The use of triethylamine instead of 1-ethylpiperidine gave 2 in 50 % yield ( entry 2 ).

The reverse reaction occurs upon irradiation of a solution of dimer 7 in chloroform at 303 nm for 48 h using a ﬂuorometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp , giving monomer 4 in 41 % yield and recovered 7 in 54 % yield ( Scheme 6 ).
However , irradiation of 4 in MeOH with a 150 W xenon lamp for 72 h aﬀorded novel dimers 8a and 8b in 5 % and 6 % yield , respectively , with recovered 4 in 46 % yield ( Scheme 7 ).
The dimerization of 4 under irradiation above 420 nm in the presence of hexamethylditin gave 8a and 8b and 9 in 24 % , 23 % , and 1 % yields , respectively ( entry 2 ).

That is , nontoxic dimers 7 , 8a , and 8b can be converted into the toxic monomer 4 by UV irradiation or basic treatment.
Furthermore , α- (propargyloxy)acetoaldehyde 1E could be stereoselectively transformed into the corresponding vinyl triﬂate 2E stereo- selectively ( entry 7 ) ; using 2.5 equiv of DBU improved the chemical yield ( entry 8 ) .

Next , an alkyl group was introduced via alkyl boron reagent generated in situ from styrene and 9-BBN.21 However , the reaction was sluggish , and a mixture of the desired product , benzyl vinyl ether , and inseparable byproducts was obtained in poor yield.
When the 3Ca was treated with n-BuLi ( 3.0 equiv ) in THF , the rearrangement did not proceed cleanly and yielded the allylic alcohol 4Ca in low yield of 19 % with 92 / 8 selectivity.
By the addition of N,N,N′,N′- tetramethylethylenediamine ( TMEDA ) using an excess amount of n-BuLi , 4Ca was obtained in enhanced chemical yield ( entry

Then , the obtained ester 5a and 5b could be transformed into the hydrochloride salts of baclofen and paroxetine , respectively , according to ref 7 , and a reductive
The Re face of pyrazolamide 1a was shielded by the neighboring 2,6-diisopropylphenyl group of the ligand L-PiPr2 , and the nucleophile attacked from the Si face predominantly to give the S-conﬁgured product 3a.
provided compound 8 in good yield ( 81 % ) after puriﬁcation on silica gel ( Supporting Information Figures S7 and S8 ).
The reaction provided compound 10 in good yield ( 76 % ) ( Supporting Information Figures S11 and S12 ).
Protection of the secondary alcohol was then achieved with allyl bromide in THF in the presence of excess sodium hydride to give compound 11 in 85 % yield ( Supporting Information Figures S13 and S14 ).
This was achieved by reacting 8 with excess acetic anhydride in pyridine at room temperature to give protected derivative 13 in good yield ( 74 % ) after puriﬁcation ( Supporting Information Figures S17 and S18 ).
The reaction provided desired hexa-functionalized derivative 14 with moderate yield ( 53 % ) ( Supporting Information Figures S19 and S20 ).
The hydrolysis of compound 14 under basic conditions ( KOH / H2O-THF mixture ) gave rise to desired hexa-carboxylic acid derivative 1 in 85 % yield .

As an example , compound 14 was allowed to react with methyl sulfonyl chloride to provide compound 15 in good yield ( 71 % ) ( Supporting Information Figures S25 and S26 ).
The benzyl pyrrole intermediate ( 9 ) ( Scheme 1 ) was obtained very easily after simple work up from its corresponding salt of carboxylic acid at room temperature as a pure solid and can be stored in a refrigerator for a few weeks.
The corresponding carbamate 2b was isolated in an almost quantitative yield of 98 % ; however , the synthesis of the corresponding chloroformate is quite complicated and time- consuming and can be synthesized with only 40 % yield.7 CSI also works very well with multivalent alcohols such as 2,2- dinitropropane-1,3-diol ( 1c ).
The product was determined to be 9,9,10,10- tetraﬂuoro-1,2,4,12-tetraphenyl[2.2]paracyclophan-1-ene by X-ray crystallography and is proposed to be formed via the ﬁrst reported example of reductive deﬂuorination by a Grignard reagent .
It has been previously reported that a palladium - catalyzed Kumada cross-coupling reaction of diiodide 5 generated products 6 and 7 in 20 % and 21 % yield , respectively.15 We were motivated to revisit this reaction for two reasons.
The sequential reductive deﬂuorination and nucleophilic substitution of ﬂuorine in our proposed reaction is reminiscent of the famous reaction reported by MacNicol and Robertson22 in which perﬂuorodecalin is converted into octa(phenylthio)- naphthalene by excess NaSPh ( Scheme 4 ).
We observed that when an authentic sample of proposed intermediate 7 was subjected to the same reaction conditions ( 6 equiv of PhMgBr / PdCl2 / reﬂux / THF ) , product 8 was again produced , isolated in 20 % yield from a complex mixture of products via column chromatography.
10 In that work , we postulate a mechanism in which the oxygen bridge of intermediate amino-substituted 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ( 5 ) is opened with assistance of the nitrogen lone pair to give a 4-amino-1- hydroxy-1H-xanthen-9(2H)-one ( Scheme 1 ; 6 ; E1 and E2 are electron - withdrawing groups ).
We reason that elimination of water would be much more diﬃcult in the absence of an electron - withdrawing group on position 2 , and in that case it could be possible to isolate the intermediate 1-hydroxy-1H-xanthen-9(2H)-one ( 6 ).
In order to evaluate our synthetic methodology toward the construction of the basic skeleton of more complex xanthone natural products , dimeric chromone 11 was synthesized from readily available bisphenol ( 8 ) and transformed to dimeric dihydroxanthone 12.
Thus , according to Scheme 3 , acetylation and acid catalyzed Fries rearrangement14 led almost quantita- tively to 1,1′-(4,4′-dihydroxy-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3,3′-diyl)bis- ( ethan-1-one ) (9),15 which was readily transformed into bischromone 11 , via the corresponding double enaminone ( 10 ).
Finally , isocyanide and acrylonitrile under reﬂux in toluene successfully aﬀorded 12 in 55 % yield over the three steps .
This initial screening was performed with a 5 mol % catalyst loading and resulted in the selection of the ﬁve catalysts 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ( Figure 1 ) , respectively , providing 8 % , 6 % , 38 % , 38 % , and 4 % of partial conversion9 of enyne substrate 8c ( R = TBS ) into cycloheptene 9c , when running the reaction in toluene at 80 ° C during 48 h with complete exo regioselectivity.
Under similar conditions at 5 mol % catalyst , the tertiary alcohol 8a was unreactive and the acetate 8b only poorly reactive , giving 9b in 7 % , 10 % , and 5 % yields with catalysts 5 , 6 , and 7 , respectively ( 2 and 4 did not induce any reaction with 8a and 8b ) , and showing at the o-tolyl substituted Stewart - Grubbs catalysts with this propargylic acetate .
In addition , the more challenging acetate substrate 8b could also be converted into diene 9b in a reasonable 55 % yield , yet in the presence of 15 mol % of the Stewart - Grubbs catalyst 6 ( entry 10 ).
The reaction of 16 with CBr4 in the presence of PPh3 aﬀorded tetrabromo derivative 17 , whose dehydrobromination with n-BuLi was followed by capturing the dilithiated species with TMSCl.
The desired disilylated tetrayne 18 was isolated in high yield.
Desymmet- rization of 18 using MeLi in THF at 10 ° C gave a statistical mixture of 19 and 20 in isolated yields of 48 % and 39 % , respectively ( Scheme 2 ) .
Synthesis of the long shaft ( a ) of molecules 1 and 2 ( Chart 1 ) started with Friedel − Crafts to 7,29 whose Sonogashira alkylation of 4-bromobiphenyl coupling with ((3-ethynylbicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl)ethynyl)- trimethylsilane30,31 ( 8 ) aﬀorded silyl derivative 9 ( Scheme 1 ).
The trimethylsilyl group was removed using TBAF , and corresponding alkyne 10 was obtained in a nearly quantitative yield .
Anthracene 11 was coupled with TMSA in reﬂuxing Et2NH under PdCl2(PPh3)2 / CuI catalysis to obtain the silylated derivative 13 in excellent yield.32 Diels− Alder addition of benzyne , generated in situ from anthranilic acid and isoamyl nitrite , to anthracene 13 aﬀorded the desired silylated triptycene 14.33 Both trimethylsilyl groups were removed in an almost quantitative yield using either K2CO3 in the mixture of THF and methanol33 or TBAF in THF.
Double lithiation of 12 followed by the reaction with paraformaldehyde gave diol 15 , whose oxidation using Dess−
Sonogashira coupling with excess 1,4-diiodo-2,3-dichlorobenzene (24)35 at a slightly elevated reaction temperature ( 40 ° C , most likely required due to the high steric demand of the adamantyl unit ) gave a mixture containing 25 as the expected major product and 26 as a minor side product ( Scheme 3 ) .
The last step in the synthesis of the long shaft ( 4 ) was the coupling of alkyne 10 with excess 1,4-diiodobenzene , which proceeded in 78 % yield.
The Sonogashira coupling of iodo derivative 4 with alkynes 5 and 6 aﬀorded the desired molecular rotors 1 and 2 in 76 and 70 % yield , respectively ( Scheme 5 ).
The second approach was inspired by the preparation of conjugated polyynes , where the crucial step is a stepwise synthesis of an internal triple bond based on the Fritsch− Buttenberg − Wiechell rearrangement.36,37 At ﬁrst , alkyne 10 was converted to ynone 32 in two steps ( Scheme 7 , route A ).
Lithiation of 10 followed by a reaction with paraformaldehyde resulted in alcohol 33 , which was subsequently oxidized to ynone 32 by Swern oxidation .
A one - step conversion of 10 to 32 based on the formylation of the lithiated alkyne with anhydrous DMF did not produce any of the expected 32 , and only starting material 10 was isolated from the crude reaction mixture ( Scheme 7 , route B ).
In contrast , carboxylation of the lithium acetylide derived from 10 by gaseous CO2 gave acid 34 in excellent yield.
The following DIBAL reduction failed , however , and 1H NMR of the crude reaction mixture contained starting material 35 and mere traces of the desired ynone 32 ( Scheme 7 , route C ) .
The addition of lithiated 30 to ynone 32 resulted in a nearly quantitative yield of racemic alcohol 36 , whose Swern oxidation gave ketone 37 in 79 % yield ( Scheme 8 ).
Alkyne 40 was easily available from ClSi(TMS)3 and BrMgCCH in THF at room temperature.38 Its Sonogashira coupling with bromo derivative 41 gave desired model structure 39 in 82 % yield.
The reaction yielded alkynes 44 and 45 in 69 and 25 % yield , respectively , at an elevated temperature ( 40 ° C ).
Deprotection of 44 using TBAF in THF gave the unstable terminal alkyne 46 in 90 % yield as a white crystalline solid that turned black instantly after exposure to air.
The triple bond was indeed silylated , but iodine was surprisingly replaced by hydrogen at the same time ; dichloro derivative 47 was isolated as the only product in 76 % yield ( Scheme 10 ) .
With carbamates as amide component , the corresponding N - protected amidomethylarenes 6c and 6d were obtained in 45 % and 71 % yield , respectively.
In addition , highly functionalized amides are suitable substrates for this three - component reaction , Thus , the reaction of the protected valinamide 7 provided the amino acid derivate 8 in 63 % yield ( Scheme 2 ).
The reaction with sterically hindered pivaloyl amide proceeded in a chemoselective manner , and the amidoalkylated product 10k was obtained in 66 % yield.
However , we were not able to detect or isolate any acylimine species.26 The only product we could obtain from the two - component reaction was bisamide 11 , derived from a two-fold addition of benzamide to formaldehyde.
Treatment of the bisamide 11 with 2-bromoanisole as the nucleophilic arene component in the presence of 5 mol % of Bi(OTf)3 furnished the expected amidoalkylated product 10d in 67 % yield ( Scheme 5 ) .
isobutyraldehyde ( 13 ) , and mesitylene ( 9a ) led to the selective formation of enamide 14 in 75 % yield ( Scheme 9 ).
In the case of 2-benzyloxyacetaldehyde , the corresponding 1,2-amino alcohol 19d could be isolated in 77 % yield.
The reaction of Boc- protected valinamide 21 furnished the corresponding product 22 in 62 % yield and with a 2 : 1 diastereoselectivity .
Therefore , the reaction of 2-methylthiophene and 1,3-dimethox- ybenzene furnished the products 23a and 23c in 61 and 58 % yield ( Scheme 14 ).
Reaction with 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzaldehyde provided the product 28e in 66 % yield.
Only in the case of urethane was the desired product 29g formed , albeit in only 33 % yield.
The reaction carried out in THF under a N2 atmosphere led to the allyllic alcohol 9a in 70 % yield with high regioselectivity ( 9a:10a = 96 : 4 in the crude reaction mixture by NMR analysis ) ( Scheme 4 ).
The expected formation of the lactone 11a through in situ cyclization of 9a was observed only in trace ( less than 5 % by GC − MS analysis ) both in THF or in MeCN , even after prolonged reaction time ( 24 h ) at higher temperature ( 80 ° C ).
Indeed , 9a gave the desired 11a in 85 % yield in the presence of t-BuOK ( 1 equiv ) at room temperature ( Scheme 4 ) .
In the case of 1h , even this procedure failed to avoid rearrangement ( Table 1 , entry 9 ) , and we isolated a 3 : 1 unseparable mixture of 11h and 13h ( NMR analysis ).
Although the mechanism of thoroughly investigated , acid- the rearrangement was not catalyzed cleavage of 11 , followed by cyclization , can give phthalides 13 ( Scheme 5 ).
According to this hypothesis , we observed the complete rearrangement of 11h to 13h by adding a drop ( 20 μL ) of 1 M HCl to the NMR tube containing the 3 : 1 mixture of 11h and 13h in deuterated acetone after 14 h at room temperature .
rearrangement to 13 , was ruled out : when 9a was treated with NaOH under the reaction conditions of Table 2 , 11a was not detected in the reaction mixture.27
Indeed , the reaction mixture ( procedure A ) containing crude 11b with 1 M H2SO4 ( 6 equiv ) at 60 ° C for 1.5 h aﬀorded 13b in 61 % yield.
Conversely , our attempts to prepare 13 avoiding basic reaction conditions were unsuccess- ful ; the reaction of crude 9h with 1 M H2SO4 gave 14h as the main isolated product , according to Scheme 6 .
The Journal of Organic Chemistry 8a − c in the presence of the [Rh(COD)OH]2 / dppf catalytic system to give hydroarylation derivatives 10a − c as main together with regioisomers 9a − c ( Scheme 7 ) ; products , cyclization of 10a − c under usual conditions in the presence of t-BuOK led in high yield to the corresponding lactones 12a− c.
Interestingly , the substrate 6d bearing a secondary alcoholic group ( which exhibited a lower directing ability in comparison with a tertiary one in the palladium - catalyzed reaction with aryl iodides)2c aﬀorded only the isomer 10d when reacted with 8a under rhodium catalysis ( Scheme 8 ) .
of this procedure are summarized in Table 3 : products were obtained as single isomers in satisfactory overall yield and , besides arylboronic acids , also potassium β-stiryltriﬂuoroborate 8f aﬀorded the target lactone 12i ( entry 7 ) .
Treatment of 1a using 5 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst in DMSO under CO / O2 atmosphere and TFA as an additive at 60 ° C aﬀorded the desired product 5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol- 2(3H)-one ( 2a ) in only 36 % yield ( Table 1 , entry 1 ).
benzohydrazide ( 3a ) was subjected to the standard reaction conditions , the corresponding product 3,5-diphenyl-1,3,4- oxadiazol-2(3H)-one ( 4a ) was obtained in only 15 % yield.
After careful modiﬁcation of the reaction conditions , we found that only the employment of Ag2CO3 as the oxidant at 60 ° C for 6 h could provide the desired product 4a in 62 % yield , while other oxidants were inactive ( see the Supporting Information for details ).
After methylation , Mitsunobu reaction , and deprotection , compound 2f was successfully converted to the corresponding BMS - 191011 in 78 % yield ( Scheme 2 ).
Subsequently , the coordination of carbonyl group with Pd complex aﬀords a ﬁve - membered palladacycle B , which further reacts with CO to form intermediate C.
Unexpectedly , we found that the use of terminally substituted oleﬁns such as 1h in this cyclopropanation reaction leads to formation of 4d , the same product ( with similarly high diastereoselectivity ) we had previously observed when employ- ing branched allyl moieties.
the crotyl amide 10 underwent cyclopropanation and aﬀorded the 6-methyl cyclopropanation product 11 ( as determined by 2D - NMR analysis ) in quantitative yield and a dr of 4 : 1 ( Scheme 7b ).
In addition , alkynylation of the corresponding 2- naphthamide smoothly occurred at the less hindered position , aﬀording 3l in 88 % yield.
As depicted in Scheme 5 , 1.130 g ( 4.0 mmol ) scale of 1f could be converted to 3f in 75 % yield under the optimized reaction
Next , conversion of the directing amide group was also illustrated by treating 3f with Schwartz ’s reagent , providing the corresponding aldehyde 8a in 82 % yield.
Subsequently , reaction with BF3 the TIPS could be easily converted to a phenyl group to yield 8c in 95 % yield through the Sila − Sonogashira coupling reaction , which means other aryl substituents could be similarly introduced.
Puriﬁcation of the crude product by ﬂash chromatography ( PE : EA = 10 : 1 , Rf = 0.3 ) on silica gel aﬀorded 3f with 75 % yield .
Puriﬁcation of the crude product by ﬂash chromatography ( PE : EA = 100 : 1 , Rf = 0.6 ) on silica gel aﬀorded 8a as a colorless oil with 72 % yield ( 56.8 mg ).
Puriﬁcation of the crude product by ﬂash chromatography ( PE : EA = 100 : 1 , Rf = 0.5 ) on silica gel aﬀorded 8a as a colorless oil with 95 % yield ( 59.7 mg ).
These reductive Heck approaches operate through the cyclic intermediate A , resulting from the oxidative addition of aryl bromide to the Pd(0) - species and subsequent triple bond insertion , which then undergoes the reduction with HCOONa ( sodium formate ) into the 3-benzazepine of type 2.
Pd(PPh3)4 - catalyzed reaction of 1a with 1.5 equiv of 3a and K3PO4 as a base conducted under microwave irradiation at 110 ° C for 15 min in DMF resulted in 70 % conversion of 1a but gave only 13 % yield of the desired 3-benzazepine 4a as determined by 1H NMR of the
Switching to a DMF / water ( 3 : 1 ) mixture as solvent system led to full conversion of 1a and an improved 31 % yield for 4a ( Table 1 , entry 2 ).
The reaction of 1a with penten-1-ylboronic acid 3n also resulted in a good 52 % yield of 3-benzazepine 4k ( Table 3 , entry 11 ).
in addition to the desired Heck − Suzuki product 4 the formation of byproduct 5 that results from the direct Suzuki coupling of the aryl bromide moiety of 1 with organoboron reagent 3 could be observed.
Interestingly , in this case , in addition to the standard product 4 another unexpected 3-benzazepine product 6 was formed resulting from the double incorporation of organoboron
Crude reaction mixture analysis showed no starting material remained , with griseofulvin being regenerated from degradation of the 1,2- and 1,4-adducts during isolation.15 The (S,S)-4 ligand proved similar in reactivity to provide 1,2-adduct 20 ( 54 % ) and 1,4-adduct 21 ( 25 % ) and recovered griseofulvin.
We also brieﬂy investigated the decarboxylation of 2a and showed this to be a facile process under Krapcho conditions to provide ester 7a ( Scheme 2 ) .
In presence of Ru(bpy)3Cl2 , Togni ’s reagent 2c , and to our delight , compound 1a was K2HPO4 transformed to product 3a in 36 % yield through an aryltriﬂuoromethylation / desulfonylation cascade reaction when 5 W blue LEDs were used as light source ( Table 1 , entry 1 ).
For example , the reaction of 4a under the standard reaction conditions led to the product 5a through a triﬂuoromethylation / 1,4-aryl shift / desulfonylation cascade reaction.
this protocol , we also prepared amide 6a and subjected it to the reaction conditions , and triﬂuoromethylated isoquinolinedione 7a was obtained smoothly in 70 % yield ( Scheme 3 ).
The photocatalyst [Ru(bpy)3]2+ was activated by visible light to the excited state [Ru(bpy)3]2+* , which then reduced CF3SO2Cl to generate CF3 radical after release of a Cl− and SO2 The CF3 radical was trapped by 1 , 4 ( X = SO2 ) or 6 ( X = CO ) to give the intermediate B after formation of a new C(sp3)−CF3 bond .
Arylmigration / desulfonylation cascade reaction occurred to form the intermediate C when X is SO2 , due to the instability of intermediate B.15 Cyclization of amidyl radical to the aryl ring of intermediate C led to the ﬁnal product 3 if the substituent R on the N atom was alkyl ( R = alkyl ) , a process that seems prefer to be trapped by the aromatic ring.15 In contrast , 5 was obtained through the direct hydrogen abstraction from the medium , which might be owing to the stability of nitrogen radical when R was aryl group.56 For X = CO , the intramolecular radical cyclization of B led to the intermediate A , which produced isoquinolinedione 7 after oxidation and deprotonation .
The other two allyl propargyl ethers 23 and 28 were prepared similarly from 21 ( Scheme 2 ).
The 4β-isomer 30 was prepared from D-galactal triacetate via Ferrier reaction with incorporate of isopropyl alcohol.
On the other hand , reduction of triacetates of D-galactal ·OEt2 and triethylsilane as well as D-glucal triacetate with BF3 and protection gave 31 and 33 , separately , as reported by the groups of Chamberlin12a and Overkleeft,12b respectively [ details are shown in the Supporting Information (SI)].
Each of these was converted similarly as before to 32 and 34 .
treatment of 20 under the standard Wittig rearrangement conditions ( with n-BuLi in THF at − 78 ° C ) for 30 min aﬀorded 37 in 75 % yield as a single ( 9R ) stereoisomer via [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement ( Scheme 3 ).
On the contrary , 4-propargyl ether 14 ( with 3-H ) was converted in 72 % to the same products as above , 38 and 39 , in a diﬀerent ( 5 : 1 ) ratio under the same conditions.
Thus , the reaction of 14 proceeded mainly via a [1,2]-Wittig process , leading to 38-(7R) , and to a lesser extent via a minor [2,3]-Wittig process , giving 39-(7R ).
Workup gave two products in a 10 : 1 ratio in 46 % yield : 40-(7R) ( X = H ) , and 41-(7S) ( X = H ).
First the 4β-propargyl ether 30 ( derived from D-galactose ) was treated with n-BuLi in THF solvent to aﬀord two [2,3]-Wittig products 42-(7R) and 43-(7S) in 2 : 1 ratio ( Scheme 3 ).
The axial one ( 32 ) aﬀorded a 2 : 1 mixture of product 44-(7R) and 45-(7S) , both from the [2,3]- Wittig process.
On the other hand , 34 yielded exclusively the [2,3]-Wittig product 46-(7R) in 78 % .
Stabilizing interactions between the Li+ ion and triple bond can also be observed in the resulting intermediate 14-Int-re , though smaller than in the transition state .
20-TSM1-re ( Scheme 12 ) has a structure very similar to that of 14-TSM1-re ( Figure S4 in the SI ) and leads directly to the intermediate 20-Int-re , analogous to 14-Int-re , from which the formation of 20-[1,2]R and 20-[2,3]R is possible.
When [Cp*RhCl2]2 ( 2.5 mol % )18 was employed as catalyst together with CsOAc ( 50 mol % ) as additive at 60 ° C in MeCN , the desired annulation product 3a was obtained in 15 % yield ( entry 1 ).
Changing the OMe group ( 1a ) to an O-pivaloyl group ( 1a′ ) , did not give any desired product 3a ( entry 2 ).
Various solvents were screened , and MeOH was proven to be optimal , aﬀording 3a in 35 % yield ( entry 4 ).
A stoichiometric amount ( 200 mol % ) of CsOAc gave an improved yield of 3a ( entry 5 ).
Moreover , the reaction eﬃciency could be increased at higher temperature ( 80 ° C ) , aﬀording 3a in 65 % yield ( entry 6 ) .
Notably , the use of alkyl aryl disubstituted alkynes gave a high regioselectivity , aﬀording 3o and 3p as the single regioisomer.
Surprisingly , in addition to the 7-membered product 5a′ , 1,2-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]- quinolin-4-one 5a was also isolated as the main product ,

Changing of OMe ( 1a ) to an O-pivaloyl group ( 1a′ ) did not give any desired product 7a or 7a′ ( entry 2 ).
Various solvents were tested , and DMF was proven to be optimal , aﬀording 7a in 78 % yield ( entry 6 ) .
the C6-methoxy- substituted indoline gave the 7-membered product 5l′ as the sole product.22 In addition , other dialkyl-substituted alkynes
The [11C]-1 was also converted to 11C - labeled fursultiamine ( [11C]-2 ) , a prodrug of vitamin B1 , by disulﬁde formation with S-tetrahydrofurfurylthiosulfuric acid sodium salt.
Subsequently , 7 underwent further lithiation at the 5 position of the thiazole ring , and the subsequent reaction with 2-bromoethoxy(tert-butyldiphenyl)silane gave the ethoxy- group - containing thiazole 8 in 49 % yield.
The introduction of a (n-C4H9)3Sn group was carried out by reacting the product of the lithiation of 8 with tri-n-butyltin chloride to produce the stannylated compound 9.
Finally , the deprotection of two silyl groups of 9 gave the desired tri-n-butylstannyl precursor 5 in 48 % yield ( two steps ) .
As shown in Table 1 , the use of standard conditions for the rapid C- [11C]methylation of heteroaromatics,11 Pd2(dba)3 ( dba , dibenzylideneacetone ) and P(o-tolyl)3 ( 1 : 16 ) in the presence of CuBr and CsF in NMP for 5 min at 100 ° C , was eﬀective at producing the target [11C]methylated thiazole [11C]-10 with a suﬃciently high radioactivity of 2.4 GBq following puriﬁcation by semipreparative HPLC ( entry 1 ).
Highly polar impurities were washed away from the cartridge using a solution ( 5.0 mL ) of sterile saline and propylene glycol ( 90 : 10 ) , and then the desired 11C - labeled fursultiamine [11C]-2 was eluted using a solution ( 2.0 mL ) of sterile saline and propylene glycol ( 70 : 30 ).
In the presence of Asc , the major dG product detected was d2Ih ( 13.4 % ) with lower yields of the 2-deoxyribose oxidation products cyclo-dG ( 0.9 % ) and Gua ( 7.1 % ) , as well as OG ( 0.6 % ) and Gh ( < 0.1 % ) ; also , lower yields of dZ ( 2.7 % ) , dOG ( 4.9 % ) , dSp ( 5.6 % ) , and dGh ( 0.4 % ) were observed ( Table 1 ).
When Asc was not present , the major C5 - oxidation product was dZ ( also a major product overall ) ; however , as Asc was titrated into the reaction , the relative yield of dZ decreased and d2Ih increased until it was the major product of the reaction at Asc > 2 mM ( Figure 2A ).
The major oxidation products observed were dZ ( 14.7 % ) , dSp ( 10.8 % ) , and Gua ( 12.4 % ) and in low absolute yields were d2Ih ( 2.9 % ) , dOG ( 1.4 % ) , and dGh ( 1.4 % ).
( 1 ) The absolute conversion of dG to product decreased with Asc ( 2.5-fold ) , as expected , because Asc quenches radical reactions.51 ( 2 ) The major products were now d2Ih ( 6.3 % ) , dSp ( 3.9 % ) , and Gua ( 4.1 % ) , with the mass balance completed by low yields of dZ ( 1.1 % ) , dOG ( 2.5 % ) , cyclo-dG ( 0.5 % ) , and dGh ( < 0.1 % ).
The low redox potential of dOG renders this nucleoside labile toward further oxidation to yield the hydantoins dSp and dGh ( Scheme 3 ).
In conclusion , HO - mediated oxidation of dG via Fe(II) - Fenton chemistry and X- ray irradiation eﬀects oxidation at C8 of dG to yield dOG as the dominant product along this pathway under low oxidant ﬂux with O2 and the reductant present ( Figures 3A , 3B , and 5 ) .
These data , in which dOG was obtained in greater yield than the hydantoins under conditions with physiologically relevant further explain why concentrations of dOG are generally much greater than hydantoins in vivo.26,56 Oxidations of dOG have detected a four - electron oxidation product dehydroguanidinohydantoin-2′-deoxyribonucleoside ( dGhox ) , or formally a six - electron oxidation product of dG ( Scheme 3 ).
The products dZ and d2Ih result from oxidation of dG followed by initial product forming chemistry occurring at C5.
When the reductant was not present , 5-HOO-dG decomposes to yield dIz ; however , when the reductant was present , the hydro- peroxyl group can be reduced to the alcohol 5-HO-dG.
Next , 5-HO-dG undergoes acyl migration to reduced - dSp ( dSpred ) that hydrates at C8 and ring opens to yield d2Ih ( Scheme 5A ).
Indeed , a rapid conversion of native α-CD and TsIm ( more than 90 % conversion within 1 min ) into 1 was observed ( Figure 2 ).
The resulting powder was puriﬁed by ﬂash chromatography using a CH3CN / H2O mixture to give 4 , 5 , and 6 as white powders in good yields ( 61 % , 63 % , and 67 % , respectively ).
A kinetic proﬁle ( see Supporting Information , Figure S38 ) showed a rapid conversion of 2 into 5 ( 50 % of mono-2-O-tosyl-β-CDs was converted within only 20 min ).
Notably , the dioxole part in nitrostyrene 1e was unaﬀected in the present reaction conditions , and the desired furan 3ae was obtained in moderate yield.
Moreover , a heteroaryl-substituted nitroalkene also produced the corresponding furan ( 3ah ) in moderate yield.
Upon cyclization and successive elimination of HNO and H2O,9,12 C is consecutively converted to 3aa via the intermediates D and E.
We initiated our investigation with activated cyclopropane 1a ( 1 equiv ) and 3-phenyl-N-tosylaziridinedicarboxylate 2a ( 1 equiv ) to aﬀord 2H-furo[2,3-c]pyrrole 3a ( Table 1 ).
optimize the reaction between 1a and 2a to give 3a , various Lewis acids were employed , and MgI2 was found to be the most eﬀective ( Table 1 ).
The other commercially available Lewis acids such as Mg(OTf)2 , Sc(OTf)3 , InCl3 , Yb(OTf)3 , Zn(OTf)2 , MgBr2 , and ZnI2 did not lead to 3a ( Table 1 , entries 6 − 9 and 12 − 14 ).
In the case of BF3 ·OEt2 , early decomposition of DAC was observed ( Table 1 , entry 11 ) , and use of GaCl3 produced 3a in trace amounts ( Table 1 , entry 10 ) .
In the presence of LiCl at 160 ° C , 2H-furo[2,3-c]pyrrole easily gave 4a in good isolated yield ( 60 % ) after the selective mono-decarboxylation and tosyl group deprotection18 ( Scheme 4 ) .
tected isatin successfully participated in the desired reaction to aﬀord the corresponding bis-spirooxindole 4nj in a high yield of 96 % and an excellent stereoselectivity of > 95 : 5 dr and 90 % ee , which indicated that isatins had no remarkable eﬀect on the reactivity and the stereoselectivity.
The ﬁrst hydrogen transfer step corresponds to the migration of a proton from alk-3-ynoate 10 to guanidine catalyst 1 to form an ion - pair complex 12.
The alkynoate anion in ternary complex 13 abstracts a hydrogen atom from another molecule of alk-3-ynoate to form product 11 , and ion - pair complex 12 is regenerated simultaneously.
The alkynoate anion in ternary complex 14 could abstract a hydrogen atom from bicyclic guanidinium ion to form product 11 , and at the same time , alk-3-ynoate 10 and guanidine catalyst 1 are regenerated.
After complete conversion of the substrate ( 6 h ) , the reaction was stopped and analysis of the only product readily showed that intramolecular photodirect- arylation had occurred , leading to compound 5a in 92 % yield ( Table 1 ).
In this case , the reaction was terminated after 5 days and the product 5h was isolated in 61 % yield .
For this purpose , 2,5-dibromoterephthalaldehyde ( 1k ) was obtained,26 and transformed into imidazoles 4r and 4s with 64 % and 52 % yields , respectively.
irradiation ( 254 nm ) , we were surprised to observe that the reaction did not lead to a fully conjugated product , but the product of a single cyclization 5p ( “ mono ” , Scheme 1 ).
Interestingly , compound 8a , has been described in several literature reports , but its rapid conversion to benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-f ]phenanthridine 9a under brief UV irradiation had not been previously noted.
( 4 ) Phenanthroimidazole 11 synthesized from 6- bromo-1,2-dihydroacenaphthylene-5-carboxaldehyde (10)38 smoothly undergoes photoinduced cyclization into 12 ( Scheme 3 ) even though 6π-electrocyclization mechanism is obviously
Hydrogenolytic N-deprotection then gave the corresponding dihydroconduramines (±)-B-1 , (±)-E-1 , and (±)-F-1 .
6,16,17 Within this area , we are currently engaged in a research program concerning the development and deployment of eﬃcient methods to enable the diastereoselective epoxidation of a range of allylic amines.18 We have reported two complementary methods to eﬀect the formal anti-dihydroxylation of the oleﬁn functionality within 3-N,N-dibenzylaminocyclohex-1-ene 1 in a diastereodivergent manner.19,20 Sequential treatment of 1 with Cl3CCO2H ( 5 equiv ) and m-CPBA ( 1.6 equiv ) was shown to give trichloroacetate ester 4 in 95 : 5 diastereoisomeric ratio ( dr ) ; 4 may be isolated or the crude reaction mixture may be
in MeOH to give aminodiol 5 in treated with K2CO3 quantitative yield and 95 : 5 dr ( the minor diastereoisomeric product being 9 ).
Ring opening then occurs in situ , with high levels of regioselectivity for attack of trichloroacetate anion at C(1) , distal to the electron - withdrawing ammonium moiety where its destabilizing electron - withdrawing inﬂuence on the transition state is minimized.21,22 This regioselectivity is also in accordance with the Fürst − Plattner rule.23 Meanwhile , treatment of 1 with m-CPBA ( 1.5 equiv ) gave the corresponding N-oxide 6 , which upon further treatment with m-CPBA ( 3 equiv ) gave N-oxide epoxide 7 in 73 : 27 dr.20 This stereochemical outcome is consistent with diastereoselective epoxidation of 6 occurring anti to the N-oxide moiety for steric and / or electronic reasons.
It was found , however , that addition of Cl3CCO2H ( 10 equiv ) to the reaction mixture had a beneﬁcial eﬀect on the diastereoselectivity of this epoxidation reaction , resulting in the production of 7 in 98 : 2 dr , although under these conditions regioselective ring opening occurred in situ by attack of trichloroacetate anion at C(1) , distal to the
electron - withdrawing ( protonated ) N-oxide moiety , with subsequent treatment with K2CO3 in MeOH and ﬁnally Zn in AcOH giving aminodiol 9 in 63 % isolated yield and > 99 : 1 dr20 ( Scheme 1 ) .
1H NMR spectroscopic analysis after a further 8 h revealed complete conversion to N-oxide epoxide 18.
Reductive workup ( with Na2SO3 ) and chromatographic puriﬁcation gave the known epoxide 1929 in 62 % isolated yield.
Treatment of 16 with m-CPBA ( 1.5 equiv ) gave an approximately 50 : 50 mixture of two species , assigned as N- oxide 23 and N-oxide epoxide 24.
It is also instructive to pivotal compare the highly diastereoselective outcome of this epoxidation reaction with the previously reported result of trans-14 under conditions for “ ammonium- treatment of directed ” epoxidation , which gave a 75 : 25 mixture of epoxides 19 and 13 , respectively , due to the competitive eﬀects of the two directing groups in this case29 ( Scheme 3 ) .
( 3 equiv ) to the reaction mixture and 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis after a further 8 h showed complete conversion to N- oxide epoxide 24.
ring opening could be investigated , Mitsunobu reaction of 19 was used to give access to the C(1) - epimeric epoxide 34 , which was formed as a single diastereoisomer that was isolated in 70 % yield ( Scheme 7 ).
Treatment of 25 with H2SO4 resulted in formation of a single triol 41 in > 95 : 5 dr and in > 95 % mass return.
Ring opening of epoxide 19 proceeded with somewhat lower regioselectivity to give a 75 : 25 mixture of triols 39 and 40 , respectively ( > 95 % mass return ) , which were isolated in 31 % and 8 % yield.
This stereochemical outcome is consistent with attack of H2O on the intermediate ammonium 35 occurring at both C(2) and C(3) to give the corresponding triols 39 and 40 , respectively ( Scheme 8 ).
identical conditions , attempted ring opening of epoxide 34 gave a complex mixture of products , while ring opening of epoxide 13 proceeded to give a 5 : 75 : 20 mixture of triols 39 , 40 , and 41 , respectively ( > 95 % mass return ).
Triols 39 and 40 would arise from direct SN2 - type ring opening of the intermediate epoxide ammonium 37 at C(3) or C(2) , respectively , indicating that the ratio of products derived from C(2) versus C(3) attack in this case is 96 : 4.
5i However , in our case , the reaction resulted in a complex mixture with only a trace amount of the desired product 3 observed ( Table 1 , entry 1 ).
[IrCp*Cl2]2 , which was the optimal catalyst for the reaction of N-alkylnitrone alkynes in Li ’s work,5e gave only 33 % of 3 ( entry 5 ).
On the other hand , when the substrates ( 1 and 2 ) were added via a syringe pump into a DCM solution of the palladium catalyst , we obtained 3a with 63 % yield without decline of the diastereoselectivity ( entry 9 ).
Finally , in the presence of the catalyst , the alcohol cyclizes to provide the desired product 3 , which is an alternative pathway , in which the direct cyclization of intermediate B can not be ruled out.
Further trans- formation of alcohol 6 to the desired (+)-sonepiprazole 8 was achieved through mesitylation of alcohol 6 followed by the nucleophilic addition of amine 7.
Using this method , we prepared the N1-carbocyclic ribosyl 7-deazaadenosine derivative 10a , from which we then synthesized the target 7-deaza-cADPcR ( 7 ) via an Ag+ - promoted intramolecular condensation to construct the 18-membered pyrophosphate ring structure.
The corresponding 7- bromo derivative 8 , which was the ﬁrst analogue of cADPR with a substitution at the 7-position , was similarly synthesized.
Because condensation between 12 and an imidazole nucleoside 15 eﬀectively produced the N1- carbocyclic-ribosyladenosine derivative 16 ( Scheme 1),9c we
After conversion of 14 into the corresponding methoxyimidate 17 , it was treated with NaH in MeCN in the presence of an anomeric mixture of tri-O-benzoyl-1-chlororibose (13−2),16 which was prepared in situ from 13 − 1 ( Scheme 2a ).
When a similar glycosidation was performed with an isopropylidene- protected chlororiboside 13−4,17 however , the desired pyrrole β-riboside 11a was obtained in pure form.
Thus , consistent with their report , treatment of the pyrrole nucleoside 11a with only NBS in THF gave 5-bromination product 19 exclusively , while supplementary use of PBr3 as an additive successfully reversed the regioselectivity to selectively produce the desired 4-bromination product 11b .
Treatment of 11a with NH4OH in the presence of K2CO3 in MeOH successfully aﬀorded the desired protected 7-
When the carbocyclic ribosylamine 1212 was used as an amine in the condensation with 11a , the N1-carbocyclicribosyl- 7-deazaadenine ring was eﬀectively constructed to aﬀord the desired product 10a in 82 % yield , and its N1-carbocyclic structure was conﬁrmed based on its NOE data and HMBC spectrum ( Table 2 ).
Similarly , the 4- bromopyrrole nucleoside 11b and 12 also aﬀorded the corresponding 7-brominated product 10b in 79 % yield .
The 5″-hydroxy group of 10a was protected with a dimethoxytrityl group , and then the 5′-O-TBS group of the product was removed with TBAF to give 20a.
Treatment of 20a with an S,S′-diphenylphosphorodithioate / 2,4,6-triisopro- pylbenzenesulfonyl chloride / pyridine system,19 followed by removal of the 5″-O-dimethoxytrityl group of the product with aqueous AcOH , gave the corresponding 5′-bis-S-(phenyl)- phosphorothioate , which was then treated sequentially with MeOPOCl2 / pyridine20 and with H3PO2 / Et3N / triethylammo- nium acetate.21 This three - step reaction gave S-phenyl phosphorothioate 9a , which was the substrate for the next intramolecular condensation reaction.
The corresponding 7- bromo S-phenyl phosphorothioate 9b was similarly obtained.
Slow addition of a solution of 9a or 9b in pyridine to a mixture of a large excess of AgNO3 and Et3N in the presence of led to the MS3A in pyridine at corresponding cyclization products 21a or 21b in 48 % or 75 % yield , respectively.
Finally , removing the isopropylidene group of 21a and 21b with aqueous HCO2H produced the target 7-deaza-cADPcR ( 7 ) and 7-Br-7-deaza-cADPcR ( 8 ) , respectively .
Under these conditions , a good yield of desired product 3a was obtained ( Scheme 1 ).
The optimized lithiation conditions were used to prepare a selection of 1-substituted tetrahydro-β-carboline products 3a − f after electrophilic quenching ( Scheme 2 , Figure 3 ).
iodomethane gave product 3a in 90 % yield , showing that neither Et2O nor TMEDA are required for successful reaction.
The carbonyl electrophiles MeOCOCl and acetone gave products 3b and 3c , respectively , the latter being formed by cyclization of the intermediate alkoxide onto the Boc group.
The reaction was amenable to allyl bromide or benzyl bromide as the electrophile to give products 3d and 3e , respectively.
In addition , the electrophile PhS − SO2Ph provided the 1-phenyl- thio tetrahydro-β-carboline product 3f in good yield.
Addition of iodomethane gave product 3a ( 84 % yield ) but with poor enantioselectivity ( 56 : 44 er ).
treated tetrahydro-β-carboline 2e with n-BuLi in THF at − 50 ° C for 2 min followed by the addition of 1,3-dibromopropane to give product 3g ( Scheme 4 ).
We were pleased to ﬁnd that , in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 ( 5 mol % ) with PPh3 ( 10 mol % ) in 1,4-dioxane at 100 ° C for 10 min , the treatment of 1a with 2a in 1 : 2.2 mol ratio underwent a formal [ 3 + 1 + 1 ] cycloaddition to give the desired 3-iminoindol-2-amines 3a in 64 % yield ( entry 1 ).
While the loading of Pd(OAc)2 was continuously increased to 15 mol % , the reaction resulted in slightly lower yield of 3a ( 77 % ) ( entry 7 ).
Without PPh3 , the reaction catalyzed by 10 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 gave a poor yield of 3a ( 32 % ).
Alternatively , the combination of Pd(OAc)2 and P(n- Bu)3 ligand under an air condition gave 68 % yield of indoles 3a , which indicated that that oxygen is adverse to this trans- formation ( entry 17 ) .
Notably , the reaction of heterocyclic 4- iodopyridin-3-amine ( 1h ) worked very well to furnish the corresponding 5-azaindoles ( pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridines ) 3h in 85 % yield.
Likewise , 5-azaindoles 3o and 3t with direct C2 amination and C3 imidization were obtained in 63 % and 61 % yields , from the corresponding reactions of starting isocyanides 2f−2h with 1h.
Delightedly , the insertion - cyclization between 2-iodophenylethanone ( 4a ) and t-butyl isonitrile ( 2a ) was conducted in 1,4-dioxane at 80 ° C using 10 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 and 20 mol % of P(n-Bu)3 ligand , generating the expected 3-t-butylamino inden-1-one ( 5a ) in 20 % yield together with lots of unreacted starting material.
t-BuONa and t-BuOK were then attempted , and 2.0 equiv of t-BuONa gave the enaminone product 5a in 49 % yield.
tetramethylbutyl ( 2b ) and 1-adamantyl ( 2e ) isocyanides , leading to the aminated 1-indanone in 43 % and 61 % yields , respectively.
First , oxidative addition of 1 to the Pd(0) catalyst results in the palladium complex A , followed by isocyanide insertion8 to yield palladium complex B.
Initially , the reaction of (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene 1 and MBH carbonate 2a was investigated under the catalysis of Pd(PPh3)4 with N,P - ligand L1 in water alone.9 However , only 12 % yield of the product 3a was obtained ( Table 1 ).
N-Hetero- cyclic carbene ( NHC ) ligands have been successfully applied in various transition - metal - catalyzed reactions due to their strong bonding to metal centers and good stability toward air and moisture.12 As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1 , the use of the NHC ligands L3−L6 in the Pd - catalyzed coupling reaction of terminal alkyne 1 and MBH carbonate 2a in water provided the desired product 3a in 38 − 54 % yield , respectively ( entries 6 − 9 ).
When thiazolyl NHC ligands L7−L9 were used , 20 − 21 % yield of 3a was obtained ( entries 10 − 12 ).
The desired product 3a was obtained in 37 % yield in the presence of the Pd catalyst , prepared in situ from PdCl2 and NHC ligand L2 ( Table 1 , entry 2 ).
When organic solvents such as THF , acetone , DMF , and dioxane were used , very little desired product 3a was isolated ( 4 − 23 % yield , Table 2 , entries 1 − 4 ).
On the other hand , under the solvent - free conditions , the product 3a was obtained in 44 % yield ( entry 15 ) , which was relatively lower than the best result ( 71 % yield ) under water - only conditions ( entry 11 ).
With the optimized reaction conditions in hand , various substituted MBH carbonates 2a − r were reacted with (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene 1 in water , aﬀording the corre- sponding 1,4-enynes products 3a − r in good to excellent yields.
When 3a was treated with TBAF in THF without water or 1 equiv of water , 1,3-enyne 4a was obtained ( Table 3 , entries 1 and 2 ).
14 As the amount of water in the system was changed , the product mixtures of rearrangement product 4a , desilylation product 5a , and cyclization product 6a could be obtained in diﬀerent ratios.
If the amount of water was 40 equiv , desilylation product 5a was obtained in 81 % yield exclusively ( entry 6 ).
When DBU was added in the reaction of 3a in the presence of 10 equiv of water in TBAF / THF , cyclization product 6a was formed in 78 % yield and prevented the production of 4a ( entry 4 ).
By treating 1,4-enyne with TBAF , intermediate I was generated , which was converted to the desilylation product 5a with slightly large amount of water.
ABSTRACT : The Diels − Alder reaction between 2-methylfuran and 3-bromobenzyne ( 3 ) , which was generated under mild conditions from 1,3-dibromobenzene and lithium diisopropylamide ( LDA ) , gives a mixture of regioisomeric 1,4-dihydro-1,4-epoxynaphthalenes 4 and 5.
As shown in Scheme 1 , treatment of commercially available 1,3-dibromobenzene with lithium diisopropylamide ( LDA ) at − 78 ° C generated the transient 3-bromobenzyne ( 3 ) , which upon warming to ambient temperature in the presence of excess 2-methylfuran was trapped to give 59 % yield of a 3 : 2 ( 1H NMR ) mixture of separable 1,4-dihydro-1,4-epoxynaphthalenes 4 and 5.
Somewhat surprisingly , our initial attempts achieved direct deoxygenation of 4 to the desired 1-bromo-8-methylnaphthalene ( 1 ) instead the expected epoxy naphthalene 6.
However , we also of observed reductive debromination to give 1-methylnaphthalene ( 7 ).
Analysis of a reaction aliquot by TLC and 1H NMR showed that hydrogenation of the double bond occurs very rapidly to furnish 6 , which slowly dehydrates to 1 and is then reductively debrominated to 7 upon prolonged further hydrogenation.
By monitoring the reaction by TLC , we could stop it after complete hydrogenation of the double bond in 4 to obtain a mixture consisting mainly of 6 , a small amount of 1 , and a trace of 7.
Acid - catalyzed dehydration of this mixture followed by recrystallization from hexanes gave 1 ( 65 % yield for two steps ) as colorless crystals , consistent with the known 1- bromo-8-methylnaphthalene.1 Similarly , catalytic hydrogena-
Heteroarylboronic acids that are known to protodeboronate under Suzuki conditions29 reacted eﬃciently under the neutral LS cross-coupling reaction conditions to yield compounds 15 , 16 , 37 , 39 , and 46 in good yields and short reaction times.
In contrast , Na2S2O8 , benzoyl peroxide , and TBHP aﬀorded 3a in low yield , while the reaction failed under molecular oxygen ( entries 3 − 6 ).
It is worth mentioning that during compilation of this work Sun et al.17 reported palladium- catalyzed aryl C(sp2)−H bond hydroxylation of 2-arylpyridine in dichloroethane using TBHP as the sole oxidant , but this condition did not work in our hands for transformation of 1a to 2a or 3a ( entry 10 ).
Whereas the substrates carrying ortho- and para-substitution on the phenyl ring ( 1b − e,h − k,m,n ) produced the corre- sponding products 3b − e,h − k,m,n in good yields , the ones with meta-substitutions ( 1f and 1g ) furnished the respective products 3f and 3g in moderate yields only.
Further , pyrazoles 1o and 1p bearing a dimethyl-substituted phenyl ring also furnished 3o and 3p , in good yields.
Optimizationa of the Palladium - Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenative Homocoupling with 1-Phenylpyrazole 1a Leading to Biaryl Bis-pyrazole 3a
Furthermore , substrate 5h bearing a 3,4-dimethyl group also furnished the product as an isolable mixture of 6h and 7h , but the 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl ring bearing substrate 5i aﬀorded 6i exclusively.
Replacing the methyl group with propyl or isopropyl groups ( 8f,g ) , however , resulted in the formation of a mixture of 1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)pyrazoles 9f,g and biaryl bis-pyrazoles 10f,g in an approximately 2 : 1 ratio.
Further , we discovered that if the 5-position in pyrazole ring was left unsubstituted as in 8h then only the biaryl product 10h was isolated with no trace of 9h.
Finally , we investigated the protocol with 3-methyl-1,5- diphenyl-1H-pyrazole 17 and found that substrate resulted in a complex mixture of products from which we could isolate the 1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)pyrazole ( 18 ) product in 7 % yield only ( Scheme 9 ).
A second C − H activation event at the Pd(IV) stage would result in the formation of intermediate III , which on reductive elimination gives biaryl bis-pyrazole 7a.
To our delight , when t-BuONO was used as a nitro source , the nitration of 1a was successfully achieved , and 2a was obtained in 70 % yield ( entry 5 , Table 1 ) .
In addition , the selective reduction of 1a to (1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-8-yl)methanamine 3a was achieved.
Thus , 1a could be selectively reduced to 3a in 92 % · yield by using 20 equiv of NaBH4 in the presence of NiCl2 6H2O ( 10 mol % ) ( eq 2 , Scheme 2 ).
Next , palladacycle intermediate A was prepared through a stoichiometric reaction of Pd(OAc)2 with 8-methylquinoline 1a in AcOH according to reported literature ( eq 3 , Scheme 3 ).
Initially , binuclear palladacycle species A was produced from 1a and Pd(OAc)2,19 and the NO radical generated from tert-butyl nitrite was converted to the NO2 radical under aerobic conditions.11d,16 Then the addition of NO2 radicals to the palladium center of A delivered Pd(III)− Pd(III) species B10,21 and / or Pd(IV)−Pd(II) species C.10,22,23
The reductive elimination of B and / or C in the presence of another molecule of 1a could deliver 2a and regenerate A.10,21−23 ■ CONCLUSION In summary , we have developed a palladium(II) - catalyzed sp3 C − H nitration of 8-methylquinolines to give 8-(nitromethyl)- quinolines in moderate to excellent yields under relatively mild conditions.
The coupling of ethyl propiolate 2a , tosyl azide 3a , and diisopropyl- amine 4a readily took place to aﬀord amidine10a 5 as the sole product , and the aldehyde 1a failed to react when the substrates were stirred with 10 mol % CuI and 1.2 equiv K3PO4 for 0.5 h
However , increasing the reaction temperature to reﬂux for 24 h led to the coupling of all the substrates to aﬀord ester 6 and coumarin 7a in 19 % and 30 % , respectively , along with amidine 5 in 48 % ( entry 2 ).
The best results observed at 130 ° C [ 150 W , closed vial ] to aﬀord the target heterocycle 7a in 1 h with up to 88 % along with 7 % of 6.
Furthermore , the reaction in sealed tube without microwave irradiation aﬀorded 7a in 34 % yield ( entry 7 ) .
The reaction of aldehydes 1e − g bearing alkoxy groups at the 4-position furnished 7e − g in 25 − 67 % yields.
Likewise , aldehydes 1h − j and 1l − n having bromo , chloro , ﬂuoro , methoxy , and methyl substituents at the 5-position readily reacted to give coumarin derivatives 7h − j and 7l − n in 65 − 78 % yields , while the reaction of aldehydes 1k and 1o with strong electron - withdrawing groups 5-CHO and 5-NO2 was less- successful.
In addition , 2-naphthaldehyde reacted to furnish 7r in good yield , which upon recrystallization in MeOH − CH2Cl2 ( 1 : 1 ) gave single crystals whose structure was conﬁrmed by X-ray analysis ( see Supporting Information ).
Methanesufonyl azide 3b underwent reaction to furnish the coumarin derivative 7s in 72 % yield.
The reaction of phenyl sulfonyl azide 3c occurred to produce 7t in 80 % yield.
Among other oxidants , only (diacetoxyiodo)- benzene ( PIDA ) provided 24 % yield of 3a ( Table 1 , entry 15 ) ; other oxidants were ineﬀective for this conversion .
Reactions of phenylhydrazines having electron - withdrawing groups such as chloro , bromo , ﬂuoro , cyano and nitro with 2a aﬀorded 3-arylated product 3a−3g in good yields ( Table 2 ).
To our delight the reaction provided a 30 % yield of 3-arylated product 3a ( Table 1 , entry 1 ).
Diﬀerent solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , dimethylacetamide ( DMA ) and N-methylpyrrolidone ( NMP ) were screened based on the solubility of the substrate and DMSO found to be the best solvent , providing 76 % yield of 3a ( Table 1 , entry 2 ).
DMA produced slightly better yields of 3a than DMF ( Table 1 , entry 3 ) whereas in the case of NMP no reaction was observed ( Table 1 , entry 4 ).
Molecular hybridization for construction of hybrid molecules with a dual mode of action are gaining importance in medicinal chemistry.22 To construct such a hybrid , we performed reaction of quinolin-4-one ( 2a ) and 7-Chloro-4-hydrazinylquinoline10 under optimized conditions to aﬀord desired hybrid compound 3z in moderate yield ( Table 2 ) .
We prepared the 6- phenylbenzofuro[3,2-c]quinoline by a Cu promoted intra- molecular cyclization of C-3-(2-bromoaryl) product 3d in 75 % yield ( Scheme 2 ) .
To support the radical mechanism , we carried out the radical trapping experiment by using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1- oxyl ( TEMPO ) under optimized conditions ( Scheme 3 ) , this aﬀorded TEMPO adduct 1-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy)- benzene ( 6 ).
The radical [A] reacts with oxygen to give radical peroxide which further converted into cation radical of phenyldiazene [B] and hydrogen peroxide.24 The unstable cation radical of phenyl- diazene rapidly converted into aryl radical [C] and N2 with loss of H+ and addition of phenyl radical [C] with quinoline-4-ones ( 2 ) gives the intermediate [D] , which upon oxidation delivered ﬁnal compound ( 3 ).
Performing the reaction in DCE ( 1 , 2-dichloroethane ) aﬀorded 2a in 39 % yield ( Table 1 , entry 7 ) , whereas the yield dropped sharply when MeCN , DMSO , DMF , CF3CH2OH , or THF was used as solvent ( Table 1 , entries 2 − 6 ).
the reaction was carried out with 1,1-diphenyl ethanol 3 under the standard conditions ; no desired acetate product 4 was observed , aﬀording only benzophenone and acetophenone in 46 and 32 % yields , respectively ( Scheme 2-1 ).
This result revealed that the OH group of ethynylcarbinol could not be converted to the acetate intermediate ﬁrst and that the alkynyl acetate was oxidized by PhI(OAc)2 to form product 2.
When chiral ethynylcarbinol 1f was subjected to the reaction conditions , only racemic product 2f was aﬀorded in 70 % yield ( Scheme 2-4 ) .
When 1,1-diphenyl ethynylcar- binol 1c was treated with EtCO2H as the solvent in the presence of PhI(OAc)2 , desired products 6 was obtained in 82 % yield ( Scheme 4-1 ).
When commercial (−)-Norgestrel 1q was subjected to the reaction , desired product 2q was obtained in 43 % yield with a 0.9 : 1 diastereoisomeric ratio , which is one of steroids ( Scheme 4-3 ).
When α,α′- the most diacetoxy ketone 2c was treated with diluted HCl in MeOH , α,α′-dihydroxylketone 7c was obtained in 73 % yield.
Interestingly , the glycerol product 8c was isolated in 92 % yield by reduction of 2c with excess NaBH4 ( Scheme 4-4 ) .
Because glycerine product 8c was obtained easily by reduction of NaBH4 , we anticipated that we could obtain glycerine product 8 from ethynylcarbinol 1 by a one - pot reaction ( Scheme 5 ).
the same procedure the desired product 8n was obtained in 78 % yield with a 4 : 1 diastereoisomeric ratio value.
Dibenziodolium iodide 2 was originally prepared by Mascarelli and Benati in 1909 by diazotization of 2,2′-diaminodiphenyl 1 with sodium nitrite in a hydrochloric acid solution followed by addition of potassium iodide.41 A similar diazotization reaction starting from 2-amino-2′-iododiphenyl 3 aﬀords dibenziodolium as hexaﬂuorophosphate 4 or tetraﬂuor-
We have found that the treatment of a methanolic solution of dibenziodolium sulfate , triﬂate , or bis(triﬂyl)imidate in methanol with an aqueous solution of an appropriate inorganic salt results in immediate precipitation of a new dibenziodolium derivative.
oleﬁnation reaction between dialdehyde 1a and the diylide derived from the salt 2a , which enabled a high yielding and ring - size selective synthesis of carbazolophane 3a.
The Wittig condensation of these two compounds furnished the tolyl-substituted cyclotetramer 5b in only 3 % yield as the sole macrocyclic product.
In contrast , the reaction between 1b and 2a produced the mixed product 5c in comparable yield to that of 5a ( 27 % ).
In contrast , the McMurry cyclooligomerization of 1a produced cyclodimer 7a ( 18 % ) and cyclotrimer 3a ( 8 % 65 ) as the principal nonpolymeric products ( Scheme 3 ).
diphosphonium salt 11a was reacted with aldehydes 1a and 1b , producing cyclotetramers 5a and 5d , respectively.
The P3P + C1C route should formally be selective toward macrocycles containing 4n subunits , and indeed , cyclohexamer 6a did not form in the reaction between 11a and 1a .
Hexamer 6a indeed formed selectively in the reaction between 11a and 12a ( no 5a was observed ) , but the yield was still low ( ca.
Dicarbazole salts 14a and 14c were conveniently prepared by means of condensing 9a with dialdehydes 1a and 1b , respectively , and reacting the resulting intermediates 13a and 13c with triphenylphosphine ( Scheme 6 ).
14a was subjected to the one - component Wittig cyclooligomerization ( C2P route ) , providing the expected cyclotetramer 5a and cyclohexamer 6a in signiﬁcantly improved yields ( 42 % and 10 % , Scheme 6 ).
In striking contrast , cyclodimer 7a was cleanly hydrogenated to 8a using p-tosyl hydrazide under basic conditions ( Scheme 3 ).
The synthesis of 2 was achieved by regioselective oxidation using o-iodoxybenzoic acid.
Synthesis of alkyne 8 , a rac-1a , proceeded via the Vilsmeier − Haack precursor of reaction of 7-methoxy-1-tetralone 4 to aﬀord β-chloroacrolein 5 in 91 % yield.5 Suzuki - Miyaura cross-coupling of 5 with 1- naphthylboronic acid aﬀorded coupling product 6 in
The subsequent oxidative aromatization of 6 with dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone ( DDQ ) gave compound 7 in quantitative yield.
Finally , the Ohira - Bestmann mod- iﬁcation of the Seyferth - Gilbert method aﬀorded 8 in 93 % yield.
Cycloisomerization of 8 with 5 mol % PtCl2 at 85 ° C in toluene resulted in the formation of (±)-2-methoxy[5]helicene ( rac-1c ) as the sole product.
Rac-1c was then readily converted by demethylation using BBr3 to (±)-2-[5]helicenol ( rac-1b ) in quantitative yield.
For the synthesis of (±)-1,2-[5]helicenyl diacetate ( rac-2 ) , rac-1b was treated with o-iodoxybenzoic acid ( IBX ) in DMF to aﬀord the desired [5]helicene o-quinone (rac-9),6 which was converted to rac-2 in 68 % yield by a sequence of reduction and acetylation reactions ( Scheme 2 ).
Hydrolysis of rac-1a in the presence of Amano PS proceeded to give (+)-(P)-1b with 38 % ee in 59 % yield , and (−)-(M)-1a of 35 % ee was recovered in 41 % yield ( entry 1 ).
Next , rac-3a was resolved to each enantiomer by using (1S)-10-camphorsulfonyl chloride as a resolving agent.12 Treatment of rac-3a with (1S)-10- camphorsulfonyl chloride and Et3N in CH2Cl2 at room temperature led to a mixture of two diastereomeric helicene camphorsulfonates , (M,S)-10 and (P,S)-10 , in 87 % combined yield ( Scheme 4 ).
The diastereomers were separated on a silica gel column to give (M,S)-10 ( 43 % ) and (P,S)-10 ( 44 % ).
ABSTRACT : The title compound 4 is a trisolvated monomer 4 & 3THF in THF solution and dimerizes endothermically to form ( 4 & THF)2 with a strongly positive ( ! ) dimerization entropy in toluene as the solvent.
The preparation ( Scheme 2 ) of the title compound 4 through Br / Li interchange of the known18 α-bromoalkene 6 in Et2O or t-BuOMe with n- butyllithium ( n-BuLi ) in hexane or cyclopentane was already described.19 However , this method was unproﬁtable in THF as the solvent20 since 4 coupled quickly with its coproduct 1- bromobutane ( n-BuBr ) to give 8 and LiBr.
First , a solution of the unpuriﬁed dimer ( 4 & t-BuOMe)2 in t-BuOMe was prepared as usual ( Section A)19 from bromoalkene 6 with n-BuLi and quenched immediately with HgBr2 ( 0.5 equiv only ) to give the dialkenylmercury 12.
However , a decreased loading of isocyanate 2a under otherwise identical conditions led to decreased formation of 3a ( Table 1 , entry 15 ).
In addition , this reaction can proceed under air conditions or at lower temperature ( 60 ° C ) to give 3a , albeit in relatively low yields ( Table 1 , entries 16 and 17 ).
Indole 1b containing a pyridinyl directing group provided our desired product 3b in 48 % yield.
sterically congested C3 - substituted indole 1m and 2,3-disubstituted pyrrole 1n also participated in this catalytic amidation reaction to furnish 3m and 3n in moderate yields.
Finally , 2-(1H-pyrrol- 1-yl)pyrimidine ( 1o ) and 2-(3-methyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)- pyrimidine ( 1p ) underwent bis-amidation under slightly modiﬁed reaction conditions to aﬀord 3o and 3p in high yields , respectively .
Thus , we performed a reversibility experiment using 4k under the standard reaction conditions , which provided 1a in 50 % yield ( Scheme 1 , eq 1 ).
was observed by Bergman and Ellman in the Rh(III) - catalyzed coupling reaction between 2-phenylpyridines and N-Boc- imines.11a In addition , this reversible reaction was further conﬁrmed by treatment with n-butyl acrylate ( 5a ) , which aﬀorded C2 - alkenylated indole 6a in 65 % yield ( Scheme 1 , eq 2 ).
First , treatment of 3a under the standard reaction conditions ( NaOEt , DMSO , 100 ° C)23 aﬀorded desired product 7a in low yield ( 16 % ).
The electron - rich aryl-substituted alanes were eﬀective , aﬀording the corresponding products 3aa − ad in high yields.
Notably , the reactions of 1b with halogenated arylalanes , such as 4-bromophenyl aluminum and 4-chlorophenyl aluminum , aﬀorded the corresponding halogenated arylamines 3bk and 3bl , which may allow further useful transformations via halogen - exchange reactions.
It is worth mentioning that the reactions of sterically hindered amines such as O-benzoyl-N,N-isopropylbenzylhy- droxylamine ( 1e ) , O-benzoyl-N,N-diisopropylhydroxylamine ( 1f ) , and O-benzoyl-N,N-dicyclohexylhydroxylamine ( 1g ) with the corresponding arylalanes aﬀorded the corresponding products 3ee − ge in moderate yields ( 58 − 70 % ).
the mechanism , the reaction of 1b with [PhCu] , generated in situ from PhMgCl and CuI , aﬀorded the amination product 3be in a comparable yield of 87 % .
Although the reaction in 1,2-dichloroethane was quite slow , ligands the neutral coordinative ligand Inda - Pybox L4 was superior to the others , giving product 3 with the highest enantiomeric excess of 82 % and a yield of 60 % ( Table 1 , entry 4 ).
For diketone 4c , with the electron - donating methoxy group in the phenyl ring , a higher temperature was needed , and the reaction was run at room temperature , aﬀording product 5c in high yield and ee ( Table 4 , entry 3 ).
The reaction in the presence imidazole gave 5k with a 44 % yield in 3 days in low of enantioselectivity ( ee 26 % , Table 4 , entry 11 ).
The reaction of 7- bromo-pyridopyrimidin-2,4-dione with two similarly reactive arylboronic acids preceded chemoselective arylations and provided 2,7-diaryl-substituted pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one in high yields ( Scheme 1 ).
